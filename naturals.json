After proper maceration of the wood, this oleo. resin will yield an essential oil upon distillation. Wood from infected trees is cut and coarsely chopped, then soaked in water prior to distillation. It is common practice to add salt (sodium chloride) to the water. Being a distillation at atmospheric pressure (100\u00b0C.), the process of total exhaustion of the wood is a lengthy one. The oil is high-boiling, and the distillation waters must be cohobated (i.e. returned to the still and redistilled) in order to produce a reasonable yield and a complete oil. Agar Oil is pale yellow to brownish yellow or dark amber in color; it is a very viscous liquid of rich and sweet-woody, almost balsamic odor not unlike that of vetiverol or purified styrenefree styrax, and with a sweetness similar to that of sandalwood oil.

As little as 0.02 grams of this poison is lethal to the average human being. This amount of hydrocyanic acid can be present in about 8 to 10 drops of crude, unrectified Bitter Almond Oil. It is interesting to note that hydrocyanic acid has an odor which is somewhat similar to that of Benzaldehyde, the main constituent of bitter almond oil. Bitter Almond Oil is a colorless liquid of strong, but sweet and clean odor, reminiscent of crushed, wet bitter almonds or of a very high grade of benzaldehyde. The odor is also familiar to those who prepare or enjoy the European candy known as \u201cMarcipan\u201d. Bitter Almond Oil, which is almost pure Benzaldehyde, is not a very stable oil. An addition of 10% (but not less) of ethyl alcohol is recommended as a stabilizer, and the oil should be stored in well filled glass containers, protected from daylight, moisture and air. Bitter Almond Oil finds very little use in perfumery where it is replaced by a high grade of benzaldehyde. They blend well with anisic-balsamic types of odor.",

It is conceivable that Ambra is the result of a pathological condition caused by irritation of the whale\u2019s stomach walls due to certain indigestible particles in the whale\u2019s food. Consequently, Ambra is one of the few natural perfumery raw materials which cannot be \u201ccultivated\u201d. Pieces of Ambra are either washed ashore on various temperate ocean coasts and islands, or they are found inside the whales when these great mammals are captured for their oil. Ambra is a pale grayish or creamy-yellow to brown or dark brown waxy solid mass which melts in boiling water. Its odor is rather subtle, reminiscent of seaweed, wood, moss, with a peculiar sweet, yet very dry undertone of unequaled tenacity. There is rarely any animal note at all in a good grade of Ambra. The greater part of a good grade of Ambra is soluble in alcohol. By concentration of the tincture, the so-called Resinoid of Ambergris is obtained. When concentrated 20 times, the ambergris tincture turns into a light brown, semi-solid mass, which could be called \u201c20-fold tincture of ambergris\u201d. Ambra has comparatively little diffusive power, but it has a tremendous tenacity. Musk or Civet are required to improve the \u201cwearability\u201d of a perfume. Consequently, Ambra Tincture is particularly recommended in the more delicate florals, e.g. muguet, sweet pea, lilac, freesia, cyclamen, white rose, etc. In the modern aldehydic \u201cfantasy\u201d perfume bases, the use of Ambra or a similar \u201cbouquetting\u201d agent is a necessity in order to \u201cround off\u201d the stubborn chemical notes of aliphatic aldehydes.
