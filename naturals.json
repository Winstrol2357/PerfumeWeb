After proper maceration of the wood, this oleo. resin will yield an essential oil upon distillation. Wood from infected trees is cut and coarsely chopped, then soaked in water prior to distillation. It is common practice to add salt (sodium chloride) to the water. Being a distillation at atmospheric pressure (100\u00b0C.), the process of total exhaustion of the wood is a lengthy one. The oil is high-boiling, and the distillation waters must be cohobated (i.e. returned to the still and redistilled) in order to produce a reasonable yield and a complete oil. Agar Oil is pale yellow to brownish yellow or dark amber in color; it is a very viscous liquid of rich and sweet-woody, almost balsamic odor not unlike that of vetiverol or purified styrenefree styrax, and with a sweetness similar to that of sandalwood oil.

As little as 0.02 grams of this poison is lethal to the average human being. This amount of hydrocyanic acid can be present in about 8 to 10 drops of crude, unrectified Bitter Almond Oil. It is interesting to note that hydrocyanic acid has an odor which is somewhat similar to that of Benzaldehyde, the main constituent of bitter almond oil. Bitter Almond Oil is a colorless liquid of strong, but sweet and clean odor, reminiscent of crushed, wet bitter almonds or of a very high grade of benzaldehyde. The odor is also familiar to those who prepare or enjoy the European candy known as \u201cMarcipan\u201d. Bitter Almond Oil, which is almost pure Benzaldehyde, is not a very stable oil. An addition of 10% (but not less) of ethyl alcohol is recommended as a stabilizer, and the oil should be stored in well filled glass containers, protected from daylight, moisture and air.

        "background": "Ambra, also called Ambregris or Ambergris, is a substance of animal tissue, formed in the stomach or intestine of Physeter Catodon, the cachalot whale. It is conceivable that Ambra is the result of a pathological condition caused by irritation of the whale\u2019s stomach walls due to certain indigestible particles in the whale\u2019s food. Consequently, Ambra is one of the few natural perfumery raw materials which cannot be \u201ccultivated\u201d. Pieces of Ambra are either washed ashore on various temperate ocean coasts and islands, or they are found inside the whales when these great mammals are captured for their oil. Ambra is a pale grayish or creamy-yellow to brown or dark brown waxy solid mass which melts in boiling water. Its odor is rather subtle, reminiscent of seaweed, wood, moss, with a peculiar sweet, yet very dry undertone of unequaled tenacity. There is rarely any animal note at all in a good grade of Ambra. The greater part of a good grade of Ambra is soluble in alcohol. By concentration of the tincture, the so-called Resinoid of Ambergris is obtained. When concentrated 20 times, the ambergris tincture turns into a light brown, semi-solid mass, which could be called \u201c20-fold tincture of ambergris\u201d. Ambra has comparatively little diffusive power, but it has a tremendous tenacity. Musk or Civet are required to improve the \u201cwearability\u201d of a perfume. Consequently, Ambra Tincture is particularly recommended in the more delicate florals, e.g. muguet, sweet pea, lilac, freesia, cyclamen, white rose, etc. In the modern aldehydic \u201cfantasy\u201d perfume bases, the use of Ambra or a similar \u201cbouquetting\u201d agent is a necessity in order to \u201cround off\u201d the stubborn chemical notes of aliphatic aldehydes.

Only the expressed oil from the peels of the fruits from the small bergamot tree, Citrus Bergamia, are of any substantial interest. The leaves and twigs may be distilled to yield a Bergamot-Petitgrain Oil, the fruits are not edible. Bergamot Oil is produced by cold expression from the peel of the nearly ripe fruit. The tree grows almost exclusively in a narrow coastal strip in the southern part of Calabria, Italy. Bergamot Oil is a green or olive green, mobile liquid of extremely rich, sweet-fruity initial odor. Although the characteristics of this topnote remain perceptible in good oils, it is followed by a still more characteristic oily-herbaceous and somewhat balsamic body and dryout. The sweetness yields to a more tobacco like and rich note, somewhat reminiscent of sage clary and nerylacetate. The freshness in the topnote is mainly due to terpenes and small amounts of citral and aliphatic aldehydes. Absence of the \u201coily\u201d note is one of the most revealing features in poor or adulterated bergamot oils. The color of bergamot oil fades on ageing, particularly when the oil is exposed to daylight. The oil turns yellow or pale olive-brown. The color is also dependent upon the maturity of the fruit at the moment of expressing. Like all other citrus oils, Bergamot Oil is produced in the immediate vicinity of the plantations. The oil is used extensively in perfumery for its sweet freshness, particularly in citrus colognes, chypres, foug\u00e8res, modern fantasy bases, etc. Part of the sweetness and rich bodynote is due to the presence of large amounts of linalylacetate combined with linalool and traces of methylanthranilate. Unlike most other citrus oils, Bergamot Oil has a certain fixative effect when used in fairly high concentrations. The odor of the oil is well balanced from nature through the presence of certain coumarin derivatives, some of which are odorless and non-volatile. ",

Certain users of high-grade terpeneless bergamot oil will perform their own deterpenation, e.g. by selective solvent extraction or by the chromatographic methods. These methods result in practically colorless oils with a negligible loss of low- boiling and important oxygenated components. Occasionally, only the coarse-smelling light monoterpenes and the waxy residues are removed by simple vacuum-distillation. This yields an oil which is well suited for perfumery purposes: it will have improved solubility and intensified, rich body notes. The freshness is greatly impaired by this deterpenation.

The dryout bears some resemblance to the dryout notes of Atlas cedarwood oil. The essential oil consists almost entirely of monoterpenes and has little perfumery value. Canada balsam is used to a limited extent as a fixative in finer pine needle fragrances to which it also lends a certain freshness.

The seeds are enclosed in husks (hulls), and should not be removed from the almost odorless hulls until immediately prior to distillation. Cardamom Oil is an almost colorless or pale yellow to light brownish liquid. It darkens when exposed to daylight. The locally distilled oils are generally darker than those distilled in Europe or the U.S.A. Guatemalan oil is distilled in comparatively modern equipment and under experienced technical supervision. It is also light colored. The odor of cardamom oil is warm-spicy, aromatic, at first penetrating camphoraceous-cineole-like or somewhat medicinal, reminiscent of eucalyptus. Later, it becomes balsamic-woody, increasingly sweet and almost floral on the dryout. The odor is extremely tenacious with a delightful, warm spiciness and balsamic-floral undertone. In perfumery, the oil will not only impart spiciness, but also a warm, sweet note which fits into floral bases such as muguet and rose. Coriander oil is an extremely fine modifier for cardamom oil in perfumery. The oil imparts warmth in Oriental perfume bases, chypres and face powder perfumes. ",

Celery seed oil is one of the most diffusive odors and one of the most penetrating flavors. In perfumery, celery seed oil is used very frequently, but only in very small amounts. Used skillfully, it can impart warm notes in floral and Oriental compositions, in lavender bouquets, in modern fantasy and aldehydic perfumes, etc. Carelessly used, it may easily ruin a perfume. Its diffusive power and great odor tenacity should not be underestimated. ",

Cinnamon Bark Oil \u201cCeylon\u201d is a pale yellow to dark yellow or brownish-yellow, somewhat oily liquid of extremely powerful, diffusive, warm- spicy, sweet and tenacious odor. The undertone and dryout notes reveal a persistent dryness which is very unique in combination with the distinct sweetness. Characteristic is a dry powdery-dusty, but warm, uniform and lasting dry-out note. In the very first topnotes, one may find a certain fruity freshness, similar to the sweet candy-like freshness in a good clove bud oil. The main constituents of Ceylon cinnamon bark oil are cinnamic aldehyde, eugenol, aceteugenol, and trace amounts of various aldehydes. Together with methyl-n-amyl ketone, the latter are probably responsible for the power and the characteristic notes in good oils. In perfumery, the oil blends well with Oriental- woody notes, and the combination with olibanum is known and often utilized. The warmth and dry spiciness, the immediate sweetness and tremendous diffusive power (or \u201cradiation\u201d) induced by the addition of fractions of one percent of this oil in a perfume composition, is highly appreciated by certain perfumers.

The crude civet arrives in Europe and the U.S.A. in Zebu horns, containing about 500 to 1200 grams of the buttery yellowish paste which turns darker and more solid on age. The contents of one average Zebu horn represents the production from one civet cat in Four Years. During this period, the animal will consume something like the raw meat from 50 (fifty) sheep, and the poor cat, frequently teased in its narrow cage, will have undergone 400 to 800 painful \u201cscrapings\u201d of its glands. The raw meat, the narrow cage and the teasing are all means of increasing the production of the civet secretion which is scraped off with regular intervals while the cat is caged. It is no wonder that Civet is one of the most expensive perfume raw materials! But, thanks to the outstanding power of civet, its price does not prohibit its use by any means. From the crude natural civet, a Concr\u00e8te of Civet is produced by hydrocarbon extraction. The yield of Concr\u00e8te is about 50 to 60% of the crude secretion, and the larger part of the concr\u00e8te is alcohol-soluble Civet Absolute. Civet Absolute dilutions, or Civet Tincture, are very commonly used perfume materials. They not only present excellent fixative value, but, most important, they lend a distinct natural-animal note when used with care and with an experienced touch. Overdoses produce obnoxious notes, and it should be kept in mind that civet products tends to \u201cgrow\u201d in a perfume. Civet products are used in a \u2018great variety of perfume types, particularly in the better lotion perfumes of the rose-type, Oriental types, \u201choney\u201d- notes, narcissus bases, ambre types, etc. The use of civet extracts or tinctures in muguet and other delicate floral bases may seem surprising to the layman, but this application of civet is well known and highly appreciated. The \u201clift\u201d and radiation (diffusive power) derived from minute quantities of civet tincture in certain types of perfumes is quite unique and this effect can only be adequately understood through long experience with good grades of civet. The odor of Civet extracts (tinctures, absolutes, etc.) and of crude civet, too, should be typically animal-sweet, free from faecal notes, urine notes or the like.

An essential oil of coconut is produced this way. However, the so-called Coconut Absolute is prod- used by alcohol extraction of the crude coconut oil. The alcohol is distilled off under gentle vacuum. A somewhat different coconut absolute is obtained by alcohol extraction of the press-cake of \u201cdeoleated\u201d coconut meat. This type of coconut absolute has a \u201cheavier\u201d, more nutty type of odor and a darker color.

Coconut Absolute is an interesting material in the hands of the experienced and artistic perfumer for his work in unconventional perfumery.

        "background_info": "Cognac Oil, also known as Wine Lees Oil or Weinhefeoel (in German), is a by product from the distillation of Cognac (Brandy). An oil can be obtained by steam distillation of the residue of grape tissue and fungus precipitate after fermentation (and distillation) of the alcoholic beverage. Water distillation is also applied directly to a slurry of the yeast residue in water. The aromatic principles in Cognac Oil are generally higher boiling esters of ethyl and iso-amyl alcohols, and they do not distil readily with the hydro-alcoholic mixture which is known as Cognac after proper maturing and ageing. The crude cognac oil may be redistilled to yield a very powerful aromatic which represents the maximum concentration of high-boiling esters from the cognac yeast precipitate. Cognac Oil is a pale yellow or greenish yellow, somewhat oily liquid of intensely strong, almost harsh-fruity, oily-fatty, yet green-herbaceous odor of outstanding tenacity and great diffusive power. The rectified oil is used in flavors and perfumes in trace amounts to give \u201clift\u201d and fresh-fruity, natural notes, e.g. in liqueurs, fruit flavors, colognes, foug\u00e8res, after-shave fragrances, etc.",

A certain citrus tree in the Comoro islands northwest of Madagascar and in other nearby islands and in Madagascar itself produces large and very delicate fruits, locally known as combavas. But when a local essential oil distillery undertook steam distillation of the leaves and twigs of this citrus variety, a new petitgrain oil was discovered: Combava Petitgrain Oil. The oil is distinguished by its very delicate sweetness and freshness which is distinctly different from bitter orange petitgrain or other well-known petitgrain oils. Still more interesting is it, that this oil contains laevo-Citronellal as one of its main constituents. It was hoped that the oil could thus become a new starting material for the production of laevo-Citronellol (by reduction), a perfume material sometimes called rhodinol. Combava Petitgrain Oil is a pale yellow to greenish yellow, mobile liquid of fresh-leafy, sweet-rosy odor, somewhat reminiscent of the odor of Guinea lemon petitgrain oil and eucalyptus citriodora oil. In perfumes the oil would probably be needed in larger concentration since it appears well fit for the soap and detergent type of fragrances. It could also find use as a modifier in citrus colognes and, generally, as a new topnote ingredient. ",

It is customary to select the copaibas which contain a very high percentage of volatile oil for this purpose. Such balsams are less appreciated as commercial copaiba balsam since they dry out more slowly and yield less resin. For the same reason, they are poorer fixatives in perfumery, and thus the low-oil copaibas find their way into perfumery and porcelain-painting, etc., while the high-oil copaibas are distilled. Copaiba \u201cBalsam\u201d Oil (or Copaiba Oil) is a colorless or pale yellow to yellow-green or bluish, very mobile oil. The odor is similar to that of the \u201cbalsam\u201d, but much milder, sweeter, almost creamy-balsamic with a faint peppery-spicy undertone. There are notes which resemble furfuryl alcohol and cadinene, others may remind of the notes in Peru balsam oil. A very peculiar and complex, but very faint odor. Copaiba Oil finds some use in perfumery, but its fixative value is negligible and its contribution to the overall odor of a fragrance is questionable. Its main use is that of a blender-modifier. The oil is used in pine fragrances, woody bases, violet perfumes, spice fragrances, etc., and its low cost and good availability makes it popular for some of these purposes.

It is customary to collect and distil the material which is obtained by the annual pruning of the trees, perhaps together with twigs, etc. torn off the trees during the winter mistral, the violent storm. This is why Cypress Oil is usually available only in very limited quantities and only at certain times of the year. Cypress Oil is a pale yellow, pale olive-greenish or almost colorless, mobile liquid of sweetbalsamic, yet refreshing odor, reminiscent of pine needles oil, templin oil, juniper berry oil, cardamom oil (without the cineole-note), and with a unique dryout of delicate and tenacious sweetness, often compared to that of ambre (labdanum ambre). This \u201cpartially deterpenized\u201d cypress oil is used in perfumes of the ambre-labdanum type in combinations with cistus oil or other labdanum products, delta-methylionone (so-called), lavender oil, mandarin oil, sage clary, musk ambrette or macrocyclic musks, styrax products, moroccan chamomile oil, etc. Cypress Oil (natural oil) is occasionally used as a modifier in pine needle fragrances, in citrus colognes, foug\u00e8res, chypres, and in the modern aldehydic type of perfumes.

The roots were extracted or infused to prepare a medicine of diuretic effect, etc. The leaves of this plant become very fragrant when they are dried. The leaves of Deertongue, as the composite plant is called in the U.S.A., do not yield any essential oil when they are distilled, but a highly aromatic extract, called Oleoresin of Deertongue, is prepared from the dried leaves with a volatile hydrocarbon solvent. After removal of the solvent in vacuum, the oleoresin appears as a dark green, very viscous liquid or semiliquid mass, possessing a heavy-sweet, coumarin-like, rich herbaceous odor. The immediate odor-similarity to shag tobacco is probably a reflection of the fact that the extract has been used since long ago for the flavoring of tobacco. Under the name of Deertongue, Lacinaria or Liatris Oleoresin, the extracts have been used for many decades in the food flavoring industry also, until the coumarin ban in 1952. In perfumery, however, Liatris Oleoresin or Liatris Absolute are used frequently in chypre, moss, new mown hay, Oriental, and similar sweet or coumarinic bases. Its high content of coumarin and related compounds makes it an excellent fixative, but its intense color is a drawback in certain creations and uses. With synthetic musks, it produces very interesting, dry-perfumery powder-notes, particularly in combination with heliotropine, \u201cgamma\u201d-methyl ionone, cinnamic alcohol, etc. Although it is not a very expensive perfume material, Liatris Oleoresin is used in comparatively small quantities.",

Elemi is an exudation of a pathological product from the tree, Canarium Commune, and other species of Canarium which grow wild and, to a lesser degree, cultivated in the Philippine islands. Crude Elemi is a semi-solid, pale-yellow, waxyhoneylike mass, usually containing numerous woodsplinters, bark pieces, insect debris, dirt and earth, etc. Elemi is graded on the bulking place (locally), and it is possible to get lots which are quite clean, dirt-free and almost water-free. The odor is very fresh, terpeney, peppery-lemony, with a woody-balsamic background note. The odor bears some similarity to that of dill weed oil. Elemi Resinoid is prepared by extracting the crude elemi with a volatile solvent, and removing the latter in vacuum after proper filtration. Acetone gives a very high yield and is a very good solvent for elemi. The acetone-resinoid is pale yellow, and soon shows white masses of crystals separating in the soft, slowly solidifying resinoid. Benzene gives a lower yield, and the odor of this solvent is more difficult to remove from the resinoid. Ethyl alcohol is a comparatively poor solvent for elemi, but some perfumers prefer to extract only once with one or two parts of ethyl alcohol. It will be necessary to filtrate the extract before it cools off. A smaller yield of resinoid is thus obtained, but it presents the heart of the fragrance of elemi in a more concentrated form: fewer monoterpenes, resin acids, sesquiterpenes, etc., and higher concentration of the rare but important oxygenated components of elemi. One could call this product Elemi Resin Absolute. This is a very interesting fixative for artificial bergamot, lemon, lime, etc., as well as for the various verbena compositions, e.g. eau de verveine bases and other cologne types. In lavender colognes, foug\u00e8res, spicy colognes, etc., it simultaneously introduces freshness and fixation. ",

The concr\u00e8te is a very dark green paste, often grainy, and after standing. it displays white, needleshaped crystals of an intensely sweet odor, reminiscent of the odor of strawberry jam and caramellized sugar. Fir needle concr\u00e8te is further treated with alcohol to produce an Absolute of Fir Needles which when it comes from American suppliers is a dark green, semi-liquid or syrupy mass of sweet-coumarinic, somewhat fruity and intensely balsamic odor; briefly, it is very true to nature. The absolute of fir needles from French suppliers is usually a syrupy, amber-brown, clear liquid which has an odor more balsamic and sweet than pinelike and of great tenacity. It is conceivable that the French extracts are made from dry or partly dried material which would not produce a green color in the extract. The alcohol-soluble Fir Needle Absolute is obviously stronger in odor than the concr\u00e8te (it is free from resins and waxes), and it should be used with utmost care, particularly in perfumes other than the pine types. Additions far below one percent in the perfume oil are often sufficient to introduce the wanted \u201cnaturalness\u201d to a pine fragrance, and much smaller concentrations can be used to obtain warm and \u201cspecial effects\u201d in many other perfume types.

Galbanum is one of the typical examples of a botanical which has \u201cchanged\u201d appearance, composition and odor during the past five decades. This is apparent when we look into literature from 1939, 1936, 1926 or even further back: the description of galbanum in these works is outdated. Galbanum is collected from not one, but several different species of Ferula (big umbellifer plants). These grow wild in Iran and in the countries toward Asia Minor, e.g. Lebanon. There are still\u2014as the literature correctly says\u2014two types: a hard and a soft galbanum offered commercially. For perfumery, only the soft variety has interest. The hard galbanum is used in pharmacy and for various industrial purposes. Soft Galbanum is a dark amber-colored to yellowish-brown or grayish-green, olive-brown, very viscous liquid whose consistency is like fresh honey. It is usually contaminated with wood splinters, sand, gravel, plant fibres, insects, etc., and it will separate a \u201cfoot\u201d of a grayish mass on the bottom of its container. This precipitate contains water, sand, some dissolved gum, etc., and it has no perfumery value. It is often possible to eliminate it when emptying a container, since the precipitate is not pourable, while the useful galbanum is just pourable at room temperature (over 20\u00b0 C.). The odor of crude galbanum (soft type) is powerful, green-woody, almost balsamic-resinous, reminiscent of oleoresins from conifers. The leafy- earthy, green note is often referred to in terms, such as: \u201clike green peppers\u201d or \u201ctossed green salad\u201d, etc. There is a distinct resemblance to the odor of hyacinth leaves.

Galbanum Oil is a colorless to pale yellow or pale olive-yellow, mobile liquid which possesses an intensely green, fresh-leafy odor with a dry- woody undertone of balsamic, bark like character. A very striking description often heard is \u201clike green peppers or tossed green salad\u201d. The oil has a pine-like topnote which is less pronounced in the odor of the resinoid. The latter, in turn, has a more woody-balsamic, conifer-resinous character. The pine-like topnote can be removed by fractional distillation of the oil. The woody-balsamic, soft- green and tenacious undertone can be isolated in the high-boiling fractions. Galbanol is a trade name for the latter type of galbanum oil fractions. Galbanum oil finds extensive use, although always in very modest concentrations, in compositions of chypre, foug\u00e8re, pine, forest, moss, etc., and it will introduce interesting notes in many florals where its leafy character is necessary in the completion of a true naturalness: hyacinth, violet, narcissus, lavender, gardenia, etc. It can find use in countless perfume types and bases.",

Years ago, when galbanum was a hard, grainy mass or lumps, the resinoid was prepared in the conventional way, i.e. by extraction with a hydrocarbon solvent and subsequent removal of the solvent after filtration. Because of the significant water content in the lower grades of galbanum, it was necessary to use solvents which are not miscible with water. Acetone and ethyl alcohol could not be used. Solvent-free galbanum resinoid is a semi-liquid, dark amber or brownish-golden material, almost pourable at room temperature. The odor is intensely rich-green, woody-balsamic, yet with a dry undertone, and it has the typical \u201cgreen peppers\u201d foliage-like note which is so pronounced in the essential oil. The resinoid is usually not clearly soluble in alcohol. Extracts of galbanum, prepared with ethyl alcohol as a solvent, are available. These \u201cresin absolutes\u201d are almost clearly soluble in alcohol. They are more or less \u201cterpeneless\u201d products of entirely different odor type: less green-sharp, more softbalsamic, rich, woody and very tenacious in odor. Galbanum Resinoid is an extremely interesting fixative with an odor of its own. It is useful in lavender, foug\u00e8re, Oriental bases, chypres, pine fragrances, woody bases, moss odors, and in certain floral types. Its use in hyacinth is almost classic. Galbanum resinoid has the definite advantage over many synthetic \u201cgreen-odor\u201d materials in the fact that it mellows in almost immediately: it is possible to evaluate the result and the effect during the creation of the fragrance. Synthetic materials in this odor group often \u201cgrow\u201d or \u201cfade\u201d in the perfume with a perceptible change in the odor of the perfume within a few weeks.",

Finally, this type of fragrance has been comparatively easy to copy, although a good artificial gardenia base is more rare than for example a good artificial muguet base (lily-of-the-valley). Incidentally, a close resemblance to the natural product is not synonymous with unexcelled performance in a perfume.

        "background_info": "Ginger Oil is produced by steam distillation, occasionally by water-and-steam distillation of the dried, unpeeled, freshly ground rhizomes of Zingiber Officinale, a plant which is native to the tropical coastal regions of India. The rhizomes, sun-dried and unpeeled, have been known as a spice for several thousand years, and the plant was among the early introductions to the West Indies when the Spanish seafarers roamed the Caribbean Sea shortly after A. D. 1500. Ginger Oil is a pale yellow to light amber- colored mobile liquid. Its viscosity increases upon ageing or exposure to air (resinification). The odor is warm, but fresh-woody, spicy and with a peculiar resemblance to orange, lemon, lemon- grass, coriander seed oil, etc. in the initial, fresh topnotes. The sweet and heavy undertone is tenacious, sweet and rich, almost balsamic-floral. African ginger oil is generally darker in color and presents a more fatty sweetness. The freshness is not pronounced nor is it very characteristic of that type ginger oil. It is, however, extremely rich and tenacious. Jamaican ginger oil is usually very pale in color, mobile like a pine needle oil, and with a pronounced odor-freshness of lemon- orange-coriander-like character. The body is sweet but not balsamic, the tenacity is only moderate. The initial notes of freshly distilled Ginger Oil from Jamaican rhizomes often have a peculiar \u201crubber\u201d-like type, similar to that of freshly distilled nutmeg oil (myrcene-like notes?). This note is hardly ever perceptible in African ginger oil. Ginger Oil is used in perfumery to introduce warmth and certain nuances of spicy sweetness which are often wanted in heavy Oriental bases and in a few floral fragrances, too. The interest in the oil for perfumery use has increased considerably during the recent years of the growing \u201cspice-trend\u201d in men\u2019s fragrances and in lotion perfumes in general. The Jamaican oil lends more freshness and topnote, while the Nigerian oil will give a solid body note, a warmth which is quite unique and typical of this oil. ",

        "background_info": "This oil, which is not strictly an essential oil according to our definitions, is produced by cold expression of the peel of the fruits from a Citrus species which presumably evolved from the West Indian \u201cshaddock\u201d fruit. Although not a hybrid, the grapefruit did not exist 400 years ago, and it was still a rarity around the beginning of the twentieth century. Highly developed cultivation and refining of the fruits (better juice, meat, fewer seed, etc.) has, as so often in nature, caused some changes elsewhere in the fruits: the oil from the peel has become milder and sweeter of odor than it was only a few decades ago. Grapefruit Oil is a mobile, yellowish to greenish- yellow or pale orange-yellow oil, possessing a fresh-citrusy, rather sweet odor and a similar taste. As mentioned above, the bitterness particularly known from European and Middle-Eastern fruits and peels, is no longer found in today\u2019s American grapefruit oil. The odor resembles that of sweet orange oil to a certain degree, but also has notes in common with bitter orange oil. Thus, grapefruit oil is quite useful in bergamot compositions and for all modifications of citrus notes in perfumery. Like all other citrus oils, grapefruit oil is not very stable and deteriorizes easily upon exposure to moisture, air and daylight. Antioxidants and oxygen-free storage conditions can prolong the shelf-life of these oils. Certain combinations of antioxidants are effective in concentrations of 0.002% which is far below the threshold of flavor or odor perception. ",

Guaiacwood Oil is a soft or semi-solid mass, yellowish to greenish yellow or pale amber in color. When melted, it may stay supercooled and liquid for a long time. Once again, we meet a product which quite frequently presents odor types not reported in literature: apart from its delicately sweet, rosy-woody odor which is often referred to as \u201ctearose-like\u201d, the oil may have a \u201csmoked ham\u201d odor which is definitely unwanted, but not uncommon. It is conceivable that this odor, which was never reported prior to World War II, occurs in oils which have been \u201cforced\u201d during the distillation through the addition of mineral acid (sulfuric, etc.) to the chopped, wet wood in the still. This increases the yield of oil, but it also creates a hazard of spot-burning of the woodchips. Similar to amyris, the age of the wood prior to distillation also has some influence upon the odor of the oil. The oil is a low-cost fixative and modifier, an excellent blender in woody-floral perfumes, in soap compounds as well as high-class perfumes. Guaiac wood oil is, in turn, sometimes found as an adulterant in rose de mai absolute, amyris oil, sandalwood oil, costus oil, oakmoss concr\u00e8te, etc.",

Most perfumers have, at one time or another in their experience, tried to duplicate the jasmin fragrance by relying upon literature information as to the chemical composition of jasmin absolute. Jasmin Absolute from Concr\u00e8te is used in such a multitude and variety of perfumes that it is hardly possible to establish a rule for its use. \u201cNo perfume without jasmin\u201d is an old saying, and this is not far from the fact.

The floral note, when required, is provided by the addition of jasmin absolute or any kind of a jasmin base in 8 out of 10 cases. And the practising perfume student will be surprised when he learns how little jasmin absolute he has to use in order to obtain just enough of a \u201cfloral\u201d note.

The waxes act as powerful odor-depressors, and the characteristic radiation or diffusion of the odor of the absolute will not appear until the waxes are removed. Jasmin Concr\u00e8te is not infrequently adulterated. The most common additive is the \u201cspent wax from the production of jasmin absolute.

The greater part of all commercial juniperberry oil, however, is derived from the fermented fruits as a by-product of the central European juniper-brandy manufacturing. It should be noted that juniper berries (fruits) contain certain amounts of fixed oil, occasionally called \u201cjuniper oil\u201d. The gin-distillers are also large consumers of juniper fruits. Some of them still make their own distillates from juniperberry tinctures rather than using a sesquiterpeneless juniperberry oil which never gives the same \u201cbody\u201d of flavor to the beverage. The actual production of steam-distilled juniperberry oil is surprisingly small. Substantial quantities of so-called Juniperberry Oil are produced by another method: The dextrose-containing juniper fruits are fermented in order to produce a popular beverage. An essential oil can be produced from the fermentation mass. This distillate, which is a mixture of flavored alcohol, water and essential oil (mainly monoterpenes and other fractions, insoluble in alcohol), is redistilled, and thus the flavored, low- proof alcohol (the beverage) is separated from the terpenic oil fraction. The latter constitutes commercial \u201cJuniperberry Oil\u201d. Juniperberry Oil (steam distilled from the fruits) is a water-white or very pale yellow, mobile oil, having a fresh, yet warm, rich-balsamic, woody-sweet and pine-needle-like odor. The oil derived from the fermented fruits usually has a more turpentine-like, pinene-like odor and little or no balsamic sweetness. Its tenacity is inferior to that of the \u201ctrue\u201d oil. Juniperberry Oil is used in perfumery for its fresh-balsamic notes, as a modifier for various pine needle oils (with which it blends very well), with citrus oils in room spray perfumes, in ambres, foug\u00e8res, chypres, after-shave fragrances, spice compositions, colognes, etc. Labdanum absolute is an excellent fixative for juniperberry oil.

The botanical material is a harvested, live material, not an exudation. Accordingly, the term \u201cresinoid\u201d is misleading. However, the commercial product is usually transformed into a resinous, viscous and sticky substance by the addition of natural or synthetic \u201cresins\u201d. The viscous matter in commercial juniperberry \u201cresinoid\u201d may thus be an artificial replacement for the fixed oil which has been eliminated during the extraction. When juniper- berries are extracted with a hydrocarbon solvent, the extract may contain 4 to 8 times as much resin as it contains of essential oil. To produce a pour- able extract, the manufacturers add certain diluents, high-boiling odorless solvents, plasticizers, etc. Juniperberry \u201cResinoid\u201d (juniperberry Concr\u00e8te) is a viscous syrupy substance or a semi-solid mass, hardly pourable at room temperature. It is clear and olive-green of color, homogeneous and attractive of appearance. Its odor will usually present a topnote of the solvent (benzene or petroleum ether) which can be \u201caired\u201d out. The beautiful, rich, balsamic-sweet, delightfully ambrelike fragrance of the resinoid is, however, of a surprisingly poor tenacity. Juniperberry concr\u00e8te is an interesting material which can be used with advantage in chypres, Oriental bases, high-class pine needle fragrances or forest notes, ambres and aldehydic bases, etc.",

It appears under a wealth of trade names, etc., and in an equally large variety of colors, qualities, viscosities, etc. Labdanum Absolute from Resinoid is prepared from Labdanum Resinoid by alcohol extraction. In this two-step extraction, the yield is inevitably somewhat smaller than in the case of direct alcohol extraction of the \u201cgum\u201d. On the other hand, the two-step extraction does a better job of eliminating the waxy and resinous, mostly non-odorous and alcohol-insoluble matter. Resinoids prepared by petroleum ether extraction yield very attractive and light amber-colored alcohol-extracts (absolutes). As a result of the two-step extraction, a hard, dark and almost odorless residue is left from the second extraction. This residue finds some use in the so-called Labdanum Resins. From a perfumery point of view, the petroleum ether extracts yield absolutes of a \u201ccistus oil\u201d type of odor, more dry and ambra-like. The absolutes from benzene-resinoids have a sweeter ambre-like odor and often a somewhat \u201ccaramellic\u201d or burnt note, probably due to the higher temperatures during the solvent recovery combined with the differences in extract composition (higher content of plant colors, non-odorous plant extract, etc.). The general application of Labdanum Absolute from Resinoid is similar to that of the resinoid itself. The absolute has the advantage of being alcohol soluble, and it is better suited for lotion perfumes, colognes, aerosol perfumes, face powders, etc.",

This product is also the cheapest of all the available alcohol-soluble and generally applicable labdanum extracts. For practical reasons, it is customary to add an inert solvent to the alcohol extract, preferably prior to the recovery of the alcohol in modest vacuum. The solvent can be diethylphthalate, diethylsebacate, isopropylpalmitate, or it may be a weak-smelling, high-boiling odorant like isobutylcinnamate or benzylbenzoate. Such diluents are often used to make the extract pourable at room temperature. Labdanum Resin Absolute is a viscous, dark brown liquid when solvent is added. It is a semisolid mass when solvent-free. Its odor is somewhat stronger and sweeter than that of the crude labdanum, and the \u201cburnt\u201d notes of the botanical raw material are subdued or eliminated in the odor of this extract. Labdanum Resin Absolute is used extensively as a general fixative with a distinct sweetening effect and an ambra-type odor. Its main use is in the creation of an Ambre note, in which bergamot oil, nitromusks, vanillin and ionones also play a significant role. The term Ambre refers to the Ambra from the sperm whale. Ambrein is a name often given to a compounded perfume base of high fixative value. Various Ambreines of the trade consist of an extracted labdanum product with addition of nitromusks, bergamot oil, vanillin, vetiver oil, patchouli oil, olibanum resinoid, etc. In organic chemistry, the name Ambreine is applied to a terpenoid compound derived from farnesol and related to squalene.

The concr\u00e8tes have found extensive use in soap perfumery, and range among the most inexpensive floral-herbaceous perfume extracts. Lavandin Concr\u00e8te (from Benzene-extraction) is a solid, waxy, dark green mass of intensely herbaceous, rich but not very sweet odor. The petroleum ether-extract concr\u00e8te is a viscous liquid, just pourable at room temperature. Its fragrance closely approaches that of the dry herb of lavandin, almost chokingly camphoraceous- woody, without being sharp. It is typical of a natural extract, well balanced in odor, reproducing the floral as well as the leaf-stem-herb notes. The latter are derived primarily from non-volatile components, and this may be the reason for the naturalness in the odor of the concr\u00e8te as compared to that of the essential oil. As mentioned above, Lavandin Concr\u00e8te finds extensive use in soap perfumery where its contents of waxes, etc. is an advantage, and where alcohol- insolubility is no drawback. Sweetened up with coumarin, heptalactone, hydroquinone dimethylether, isoeugenol, etc. it forms an excellent base for a lavender soap compound. It is soluble in most essential oils and synthetic perfume materials, and it blends well with all lavender materials, amylsalicylate, oakmoss, artificial musks, pine needle oils or other pine odors, cedarwood products, cis-para-tertiary butyl cyclohexanylacetate, etc. The green concr\u00e8te can also be partially decolorized or processed to an absolute, see Lavandin Concr\u00e8te, Decolorized and Lavandin Absolute from Concr\u00e8te.",

        "background_info": "Lavandin is a hybrid plant, developed by crossing the true lavender plant (Lavandula Officinalis) with the aspic or \u201cspike\u201d lavender (Lavandula Latifolia). The resulting plant is called Lavandula Hybrida, and it exists in a great number of forms (varieties), a few of which are distinctly more interesting than the others. When visiting the lavender fields, aspic fields and the cultivated lavandin areas, one is often told that the blue color of the lavender and the grayish color of the aspic will show up in a nuance in the lavandin, revealing which one of the parent plants is predominant in the hybrid. However, it is not possible to predict the yield, the composition or the approximate odor type of the oil from the color of the flowers alone. Lavandin Oil is a pale yellow to almost colorless liquid which can be somewhat turbid and brownish after shipment in galvanized drums. A filtration and separation of water may be necessary in order to produce an attractive looking oil. The odor is strongly herbaceous with a very fresh camphene-cineole-like topnote which should not be distinctly camphoraceous. The rich, woodyherbaceous notes of the body components will usually become predominant within the first 60 seconds on a perfume blotter. It is important to evaluate a lavandin oil on a freshly dipped blotter since the characteristic notes of lavandin and the typical notes of poor oils or adulterated ones will show up immediately. The odor of the oil is not very tenacious, and after a few hours on the blotter, it may be impossible to distinguish a good quality from a poor one.\nLavandin Oil is used for its fresh, refreshing notes, and is often used in very high concentration in the perfume formula. The oil consists mainly of linalool, linalylacetate (today about 30 to 32%, in some cases even more), cineole, camphene, pinene, traces of camphor, and a small, but very important percentage (one or two percent) of ethyl-n-amylketone. This last material has often been confused with methyl-hexyl-ketone, and the latter has even been named \u201clavender ketone\u201d in various literatures. This ketone does not, to the author\u2019s knowledge, occur in nature. It does not give that \u201cmissing lavender touch\u201d to a perfume based on synthetic materials. Lavandin Oil blends well with countless natural and synthetic perfume materials. More recently the old-fashioned \u201cRondeletia\u201d-theme has found a. renaissance in the combination of lavandin oil with clove oils, eugenol, bay leaf oil, cinnamon leaf oil, etc. Other blenders are aliphatic aldehydes (modifiers, topnotes), amyl salicylate, citronella oils, cypress oil, decyl alcohol, geranium oils, geranyl acetone, isobornyl acetate, pine needle oils, thyme or origanum oils, patchouli (also. fixative), etc. Fixation is obtained with sesquiterpene fractions from various essential oils (good for soap perfumes), labdanum products, nitromusks, coumarins, oakmoss, lavandin concr\u00e8te, etc. ",

Its woody-herby undertone and coumarin-like sweetness duplicate the odor of the botanical material far better than does the essential oil. The absolute is sweeter but less floral than the essential oil, and the two materials can form a very pleasant combination. However, one cannot replace the other in compounding. Chemically, the difference between the essential oil and the absolute seems surprisingly small in percentage. The absolute contains almost an equal amount of linalool and linalylacetate (or other linalyl esters), these materials constituting about 90\u00b0/ of the oil. Typical notes in the absolute are probably derived from coumarin, umbelliferone and their derivatives, most of which are non-distillable with steam. Lavender Absolute is used in citrus-colognes, chypres, foug\u00e8res, new-mown-hay bases, forest notes, etc.",

        "background_info": "Lavender Oil is steam distilled from the freshly cut flowering tops and stalks of Lavandula Officinalis, a wild growing or cultivated plant, native to the Mediterranean countries. Distilleries located at high altitude produce oils of higher ester content, not only because of the theory that the high-altitude, wild-growing plants contain more esters, but also because of the fact that high-altitude distillation means lower- temperature-boiling. Consequently, the distilled oil is not exposed to 100\u00b0 C. hot steam, but perhaps only to 92 or 93\u00b0 C. Even this small decrease in temperature means that the hydrolysis of the natural linalylesters take place at a much slower rate. A rapid distillation at slightly reduced pressure (high altitude) may thus produce an oil with nearly all the natural linalylesters. English Lavender Oil is distilled from a different variety of the lavender plant. it yields an oil rich in linalool, but rather poor in linalylesters. However, it is not rough or harsh like the aspic or lavandin oils, but represents an individual type of lavender which is obviously appreciated in the country where it is a common garden plant, and where its fragrance is well-known and very popular. It should be emphasized, that English Lavender Oil is distilled from flower material with very few stalks or leaves. Lavender Oil (French type) is a colorless or pale yellow liquid of sweet, floral-herbaceous refreshing odor with a pleasant, balsamic-woody undertone. An almost fruity-sweet topnote is of a very short life, and the entire oil is not distinguished by its tenacity in odor. It is used extensively in colognes (citrus-colognes or the well-known lavender-waters), in foug\u00e8res, chypres, ambres and countless floral, semi-floral or particularly in non-floral perfume types. Labdanum products are excellent fixatives and the oil of Mentha Citrata can be useful for modifications. Lavender Oil is subject to extensive adulteration, cutting, etc. Among the most common additives or \u201ccutting\u201d materials are: acetylized lavandin oil, synthetic linalool and linalyl acetate, fractions from the production of linalyl acetate from Ho Leaf Oil or Bois de Rose Oil, not to speak of the more crude additives such as terpinyl propionate, isobornyl acetate, terpineol, fractions of rosemary oil, aspic oil, lavandin oil, bois de rose oil, trace additions of ethyl-n-amyl ketone and its homologues, etc. True Lavender Oil is still unequalled as a popular, fresh-sweet herbal-floral fragrance in lotions, colognes, or as an additive to modern perfume types, aldehydic bases, spice compounds, etc. ",

There are even a number of different perfume types which fall under the category of \u201cleather\u201d. Originally and truly, the odor should only derive from leather, more exactly from untanned leather. But the use of the term \u201cleather\u201d for an odor has slowly changed to become a description of the tanning and processing materials in respect to odor type. The curing and tanning of leather involves the use of a number of chemicals, and the process is well known for the obnoxious odor emitted by the wet leather in the tanning brine. Various phenols are used as preservatives, but natural tars have also been used as \u201cmasking\u201d odors during the process. The leather will acquire an odor of such tars and retain that odor for a very long time. This odor has become synonymous with \u201cleather\u201d odor. As a final step away from the original meaning of the term, also the various chemicals used in the curing are known as having a \u201cleather\u201d odor. A true Leather Tincture was produced in Germany years ago. Waste pieces of \u201cJuchtenleder\u201d or other cuttings of leather were chopped and extracted with alcohol by maceration. Such tinctures are not commercially available. In France, the \u201cleather\u201d notes are generally known as \u201ccuir\u201d or \u201ccuir de russie\u201d (Russian leather), but none of the commercial products are based upon natural leather. Birch Tar Oil fractions, Castoreum Tincture, various phenols, cresols, creosol, isobutylquinoline, cananga oil, zingerone, anhydrol ethyl labdanate, mat\u00e9, styrax, crude amber oil, cade oil, origanum oil, etc. are used in the artificial reproduction of the odor-type which is today generally known in perfumery circles as a Leather type.",

One is a native of East India (Travancore, etc.) where it grows wild, and is now cultivated over a comparatively limited area in the western parts of India. The plant is Cymbopogon Flexuosus, and only cultivated plants are used for distillation. The other plant, Cymbopogon Citratus, is possibly a native of Ceylon and parts of East India, but it is now found only under cultivation. Lemongrass Oil is a yellow or amber-colored, somewhat viscous liquid with a very strong, fresh- grassy lemon-type, herbaceous or tea-like odor. The oil is often turbid when it arrives from the producers, but care should be taken that it be kept dry (free from water) since it is able to keep 2 \u00bd or 3 % of water clearly dissolved at room temperature. This water content is definitely harmful to the citral which decomposes rapidly in the presence of water, air and daylight. The water is conveniently chilled out under stirring of the oil and it separates as a bottom liquid layer. When crude and unrectified, West Indian lemongrass oil is usually of a slightly lower citral content and it contains significant amounts of myrcene. In respect to odor, it has an earthy undertone reminiscent of Ceylon citronella oil (terpineol or borneol?), while the \u201cEast Indian\u201d lemongrass oil smells sweeter, more distinctly citral- and lemon-like, fresh and light. It contains little or no myrcene. In many tropical regions, the production of lemongrass oil is a by-product of the cattle raising: cattle feed being scarce, the exhaust grass from the distillation offers a good nutritive when added to molasses residues, etc. from sugar cane, etc. This also logically explains why the settlers continue to plant lemongrass in spite of the fact that it exhausts the soil to a considerable degree. The plant takes out nourishment, but it is fed back to the cattle who will return the yield in nature\u2019s great circulation of organic matter. It is conceivable therefore, that Lemongrass Oil will continue to be one of the \u201cbig 10\u201d of our essential oils.",

It is produced by expression (by hand or machine) of the ripe lemon peel after the juice has been removed from the fruit (machine pressing or sponge pressing of the peel), or it can be expressed prior to removal of the pulp and juice (ecuelle method of oil extraction). Expressed Lemon Oil is a yellow to greenish yellow or pale yellow mobile liquid of very light, fresh and sweet odor, truly reminiscent of the ripe peel. No turpentine-like, harsh-terpene notes should be detectable on a perfume blotter. Good oils retain their fresh lemon odor practically unchanged on a blotter until there is no odor left at all. The odor of lemon oil is not very lasting, but the tenacity varies considerably with the method of expression. The oil should be clear, not hazy or turbid, and it should not show resinous deposits. It has become customary to treat lemon oil (and other citrus oils) with an antioxidant in order to retard the deterioration of the oil when the original container has been opened, and the oil has been exposed to air, daylight and\u2014in particular\u2014moisture or water. When stored in a dark place at cool and constant temperature in a dry, ironfree container with little or no atmospheric air above the surface (carbon dioxide, nitrogen or other inert gas can be injected to replace the air in the container), lemon oil can be stored for years without losing its fresh and pleasant odor and flavor.

As in the case of Muguet (see Lily of the Valley), most perfumers think\u2014and justly\u2014that a good creation of an artificial lilac or muguet is far superior to the so-called natural extracts.",

        "background_info": "The popular and very beautiful madonna lily or \u201cWhite Lily\u201d, Lilium Candidum originated in the Middle Fast, and is now grown for its flowers in Europe, particularly in the south of France. Only rarely are surplus flowers treated in Grasse, France, to yield an Absolute of Lily (absolue de lys). According to private communications to the author, the maximum annual production of Lily Absolute in France has been about 2 kilos. These products were of dark orange-yellow color or pale amber color and very viscous liquids. The odor is usually delicately floral with a pronounced oily-waxy topnote. The balsamic-sweet body is reminiscent of narcissus and boronia, also faintly of karo-karound\u00e9. It is less green in odor than these but more fatty balsamic or cinnamic. There are notes which distinctly recall beta ionone, and the undertone is almost \u201cjam\u201d-like sweet, reminiscent of figs or plums. The odor is extremely tenacious and uniform, never pungent. It would offer interesting twists to jasmin or neroli fragrances, and it blends excellently with violet bases, cassie, mimosa, etc. The flowers of the madonna lily (erroneously called \u201cEaster Lily\u201d) have a very sweet, heavy floral, honeylike fragrance with a short cresylic, ylang-ylang-like topnote and, at other times of the day, a suave, balsamic-sweet fragrance. A true Lilium Candidum Absolute would undoubtedly find application in high-class perfumes as an interesting modifier and \u201cbouquetting\u201d material for floral or aldehydic bases, perhaps even in the heavier perfume types. Small quantities of true absolute of lilium candidum can always be made available upon reasonable notice. ",

        "background_info": "Laymen or people outside the perfumery profession are often very surprised when they are told that lily of the valley is not one of the important raw materials. In fact, it is hardly commercially available as a natural perfume oil. There are various reasons for this: The cultivated Convallaria Majalis is considerably less fragrant than its wild growing relatives. The small, decorative plant grows wild in nearly all parts of Europe, and is found plentiful even in England and Scandinavia. However, the collection of individual flowers (which are very small), would demand a tremendous volume of hand labor which is not available at low cost in Europe. The yield of absolute by the conventional two-step extraction is not exactly low, but the product does not present to the perfumer either any strikingly unique notes, or a true-to-nature fragrance. As a matter of fact, in most cases, he can create an artificial lily-of-the-valley perfume base which is technically superior to the natural absolute, i.e. it performs better in a product than does the natural oil. Incidentally, next to rose, jasmin and lilac, the creation of a lily-of-the-valley perfume type is one of the first problems presented to the advanced apprentice-perfumer. At their best, these absolutes were very pleasantly fragrant, with a delicate floral quality and a distinct touch of greenness, surrounded by a fresh, rosy-lemony body note. Butaflor Muguet is one such commercially available product. The above described notes are all quite natural, and probably belong in the absolute, but the entire \u201cpicture\u201d of this bouquet was far from that of the live flower and far inferior. Among a great number of fashionable perfumes which are based mainly or entirely upon the \u201cmuguet\u201d theme as a floral bodynote, are \u201cDiorissimo\u201d, \u201cMuguet des Bois\u201d, etc. The former is one of the most expensive perfumes on the market.",

        "background_info": "A much smaller item than the distilled lime oil is the oil that is expressed by hand or machine from the peel of unripe, green limes. Only a very limited amount of this type of lime oil is produced, and the production is mainly carried out in the West Indies where Grenada, Montserrat and other islands specialize in expressed lime oil. The uneven and very small size of lime fruits make machine expression of the oil a difficult operation. As a sort of a \u201chappy medium\u201d between hand pressing and distilling, the Mexican lime oil is often produced by centrifuging the liquid (pulp and oil) from the entire fruit in modern, high-speed centrifuges, the oil thus being separated quickly from the acid juice. This oil is obviously distinctly different from hand-pressed \u201cecuelled\u201d oil since it has been in contact with large amounts of an acid liquid. These two types of cold-processing of lime oil give lower yields of oil than does the distillation process. Accordingly, expressed lime oils are more expensive than distilled lime oils. Hand- or machine-pressed lime oil is a yellowish green, olive-green or dark green mobile liquid of intensely fresh, rich and sweet, peel-like odor, perhaps more lemon-like than the odor of distilled lime oil, but also mellower and somewhat \u201cperfumery\u201d. Thus, it does not reproduce the odor of the lime juice, and this may be the reason why many people think that the distilled oil bears a closer resemblance to the odor of lime than does the cold-processed, expressed oils. In perfumes, where the cost is of minor importance since the concentration of lime oil always will be very low, the expressed oil is generally preferred. It gives interesting modifications to neroli in cologne bases, chypre bases, etc. and it lends a delightful topnote to modern aldehydic perfumes, etc. In general, it is a fine top- note ingredient for \u201cover-sweet\u201d perfume types. In ambre bases, it produces quite intriguing notes which, in spite of their remoteness from the ambre type, lend a pleasant effect. The tenacity of the fragrance of expressed lime oil is quite outstanding. It exceeds by far that of the distilled lime oil and it is even superior to that of terpeneless, sesquiterpeneless lime oil. The natural fixatives in the oil are derivatives of coumarin, and their spicy herbaceous and sweet-balsamic odor is distinctly perceptible in the dryout of expressed lime oil even after several days on a perfume blotter.

Upon extreme dilution e.g. in ethyl alcohol, the oil shows a beautiful bluish fluorescence which fades significantly when the solution has aged.

This material is erroneously called dimethyl anthranilate and is a common perfumery chemical, produced synthetically on a large scale. The \u201cfishy\u201d or amine-like topnote in the mandarin peel oil could be due to the anthranilate which, in acid media, occasionally produces this type of odor in essential oils. In perfumery, mandarin peel oil is used sparingly in colognes as a modifier for other citrus oils, in neroli bases, in fantasy \u201cmoss\u201d notes, or as particular note for \u201cspecial\u201d effects.

Like the peel oil, the petitgrain oil of mandarin also produces fluorescence in alcoholic dilution. For perfumes, the mandarin petitgrain oil is equally interesting, e.g. in foug\u00e8res, Oriental bases, chypres and in modern aldehydic perfume types. It lends excellent body and undertone in neroli bases, and it is worthwhile noting that methyl-N-methylanthranilate does not discolor or form condensation products in the presence of aldehydes.

        "background_info": "Known to the natives for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years, and to the greater part of the present population of South America, Mat\u00e9 is an everyday tonic. It is prepared from the leaves of Ilex Paraguayensis and other Ilex species. The forests where the trees grow are known as \u201cyerbales\u201d, and the leaves are called \u201cyerba mat\u00e9\u201d. The leaves are dried, usually over a smoldering fire of certain woods. The smoke from the fire enhances the dry-smoky flavor which derives from phenolic and tannic materials in the leaves. The dry leaves are either cut or ground to a coarse powder which are the commercial forms of Mat\u00e9. The pot from which the infusion is usually taken (through a special straw) is called Mat\u00e9 (the original, local name), hence the name of the leaves. Only recently, the perfumers became interested in mat\u00e9. Tinctures, then extracts, resinoids or absolutes were produced although such preparations are not regularly offered commercially. An essential oil has been produced, but the yield is very small and the odor of the oil is less interesting than that of the extracted products. Mat\u00e9 Absolute is prepared by extraction of the dry leaves with petroleum ether. The resulting concr\u00e8te is subsequently extracted with alcohol. A completely solvent-free Mat\u00e9 Absolute is a semi-solid, sticky, very dark green mass. Mat\u00e9 Absolute has a very peculiar, rich-herbaceous, dry-leafy, woody-foliage like and somewhat phenolic or smoky, medicinal odor, resemblin that of the leaves. A decolorized extract of mat\u00e9 is commercially available, but only part of the color is actually removed. Anhydrol Mat\u00e9 and Resinoine Incolore Mat\u00e9 are distilled extracts of mat\u00e9. These products are pale of color and yet present the most characteristic notes of the odor of mat\u00e9 extracts. Mat\u00e9 extracts are used in perfumery to introduce a pronounced greenness in floral bouquets. The green notes of mat\u00e9 are free from the sharpness which usually accompanies the \u201cgreen\u201d odor materials (beta-gamma-hexenol, nonadienal, amyl heptin carbonate, methyl phenyl carbinyl acetate, etc.). Mat\u00e9 absolute or tincture blends well with orange flower bases, jasmin, oakmoss, coumarin and its derivatives, lavender absolute, narcissus, arnica absolute, tea leaf extracts, de-thujonized wormwood oil, chamomile, manevoro oil, cananga oil, castoreum products, spice oils, etc.\u2014quite a varied field of application. In the reproduction of natural fragrances or substitutes of natural perfume materials, mat\u00e9 absolute can often add the missing notes to the match (duplication).

Mimosa Concr\u00e8te is a hard and wax-like, pale yellow or whitish yellow-opaque material of a sweet-woody, fatty and deep-floral odor. It is agreed that the concr\u00e8te has a pronounced waxy-sweet, almost honeylike undertone, but its sweetness is certainly of a true-to-nature floral character. Mimosa Concr\u00e8te, as such, finds application in perfumery primarily in soap perfumes where its outstanding fixative value accompanies its delicate, woody-floral, slightly green notes. For lilac, muguet, new mown hay, violet and similar floral and herbaceous-coumarinic types, a small addition of mimosa concr\u00e8te can do wonders. In amounts of 0.5 percent up to 2.0 percent in a soap perfume, this material can make all the difference between a flat, common or nondescript odor, and a radiant, natural, deep-rich and intriguingly interesting fragrance of unusual tenacity and stability in soap. Mimosa Absolute is prepared from the concr\u00e8te. The absolute is a very viscous, ambercolored or yellowish liquid, similar in appearance to fresh honey. Its odor is very rich, floral-woody, slightly green and resembling cassie absolute to a certain degree. It is sweeter and more natural flower-like, but less spicy-complex than cassie. Mimose absolute blends perfectly with ionones, methylionones, isoeugenol, cassione (!), heliotropine, anisyl alcohol and esters, alpha terpineol, phenylethyl alcohol, di- methyl benzyl carbinol, dimethyl phenylethyl carbinol, michelia leaf oil, terpeneless lavandin oil, amyl salicylate, ylang-ylang oil or absolute, tri-methyl undecylic aldehyde (traces), hydroxycitronellal, anisyl acetone, cinnamic alcohol or styrax products (styrene-free), linalool, bucinal (para-tertiary butyl alpha methyl hydrocinnamic aldehyde), methyl para-toluate, benzyl acetate, indole (traces for lilac), etc. The absolute is used in numerous lilac bases, violet, muguet, high-class new mown hay, colognes, ambres, etc. Actually. mimosa absolute will generally act to round off the \u201crough notes\u201d from synthetic materials, and \u201clift\u201d the natural materials in a perfume composition.

A few of these oils have reached the \u201coutside\u201d world of perfumery, accidentally, or justified by their particular and outstanding effects. From an East African Compositae, Brachyleana Hutchinsil, comes an oil which is steam distilled from the wood of this tree. The tree is known locally in Kenya and Uganda as Muhugwe tree, and the oil is commercially known as Muhuhu Oil. The oil has been known for about 30 years outside East Africa. Muhuhu Oil is a viscous, amber-colored or brownish-yellow liquid of a soft, balsamic-woody, somewhat sweet and faintly floral odor, reminiscent of vetiver, sandalwood and tail-fractions of Atlas cedarwood oil. Fresh oils show a strong topnote of styrene-cadinene type and a dry, somewhat harsh caryophyllene-like bodynote. Unfortunately, the odor characteristics of this oil vary considerably since distillation of the oil demands extensive experience in order to achieve a uniform product. A significant amount of the oil consists of partly water-soluble sesquiterpene alcohols or related materials, and the presence and percentage of sesquiterpenes, etc. is largely dependent upon the length of distillation, steam pressure, etc. The wood, which is an excellent but very hard furniture lumber, has been distilled experimentally in modern stills in Europe. Taking all this into consideration, Muhuhu Oil will have some difficulty in attaining any great importance as a perfumery material, but the delicate fragrance, the low cost, and the excellent fixative effect of better grades of the oil (or of the high-boiling fractions thereof) may still attract the interest of many perfumers who work with \u201cprecious wood\u201d-notes, Oriental bases, tenacious powdery and aldehydic fragrances, vetiver bases, sandalwood variations, etc.",

        "background_info": "For some reason, it seems that whenever perfume materials are the subject of popular discussion, the few animal products ambergris, castoreum, civet and musk attract much more attention than do the material of vegetable origin. It must be admitted that the circumstances in which these animal perfume materials are obtained do contain quite exciting, romantic or surprising details. Musk is obtained from the male musk deer, Moschus Moschiferus, and possibly other Moschus species, animals that live in the inaccessible mountains of Himalaya-Altai, in Tibet, southern China and northern India. The musk is a secretion contained in an internal pouch on the abdomen of the male deer. It has been proven that the pouches can be removed without killing the animal. The killings continue recklessly, however, and the animal faces extinction. The musk pod is shipped whole and dried; it is rarely cut open. Inside is the active and valuable ingredient called Musk Grains which form the Starting material for preparation of Musk Tincture or various extracts. The musk pod is slightly ovoid or pear-shaped, two to five cms. by five to eight cms., and hairy on one side, with silky appressed hairs radiating from the small orifice in the follicle. The color of the pod is grayish-brown. When dry, the pods exhale the characteristic animal-type, slightly amine-like, sweet and very persistent odor. From 60% to 75% of the weight of the pod should consist of \u201cgrains\u201d. Musk Tincture is prepared as described under Tinctures in Part One of the present work, or it may be prepared to suit special demands by the user himself. Resinoids have been prepared by benzene extraction, but ethyl alcohol extraction is generally preferred. This produces an alcoholresinoid (\u201cresin-absolute\u201d), free from most of the fatty insoluble matter of the crude musk. Musk Tincture is pale brown or dark amber colored and will, after proper ageing, present the typical odor of musk. Musk Absolute is produced by alcohol extraction of a petroleum ether \u201cresinoid\u201d from musk grains. This absolute is a dark brown very viscous liquid of intense, yet typical musk odor. It is one of the most expensive of all perfume materials. With such precautions kept in mind, one can apply musk tincture to a great variety of perfume types: Oriental and heavy-floral types, aldehydic bases, muguet, rose, clover, violet, etc. ",

It contains a significant amount of essential oil, the balance being made up of about two-thirds of water-soluble gum, and one-third of alcohol-soluble (or hydrocarbon-soluble) resins. As a perfumery material, the crude Myrrh is one of the oldest known, and it is mentioned as far back as 3700 years ago in ancient history. Myrrh is formed as a physiological, viscous oleo-gum-resin, and thus occurs naturally in the trunks of the small trees of various Commiphora species. The trees, often mere shrubs, grow in various parts of eastern Africa, north of the Equator, and in southern Arabia opposite the East African coast. To increase yield and production, the native collectors make incisions in the bark. Some lumps of resinified oleo-gum-resin fall to the ground and become contaminated with sand, gravel, etc. Other lumps are peeled off the trunk, and these usually make a better grade of myrrh. However, myrrh cannot be evaluated justly by its appearance only. Lumps of high odor value may have a poor appearance because they have fallen to the ground; they will give a poorer yield, quantitatively. Myrrh consists of rounded or irregular tears, or agglutinated masses of smaller and larger tears of a moderate yellow to dark or reddish brown color. The lumps are usually covered with a lighter-colored or yellowish dust. The odor is warm-balsamic, sweet and somewhat spicy- aromatic; it is also somewhat sharp or pungent when fresh, but it is never terebinthinate. From crude myrrh, Myrrh Absolute, Myrrh Tincture, Myrrh Oil and Myrrh Resinoid are prepared.",

However, the usual method of producing an alcohol-soluble extract of myrrh, is the direct alcohol-extraction of the crude botanical. There are various types of resin-absolute according to the method of extraction. A solvent-free resin-absolute of myrrh is not pourable at room temperature. This is a drawback in perfume compounding and handling of the material. It is customary to adjust the amount of liquid phase in the extract in the following manner: Towards the end of the evaporation, a high- boiling, odorless solvent is added which acts not only protectively against \u201cburning\u201d of the residual extract in the evaporator, but also as a plasticizer so that the Myrrh Absolute becomes pourable at room temperature and more handy in compounding operations. In this case, it is correct to label clearly how much solvent has been added, e.g. \u201cMyrrh Absolute, 75%, with 25% Diethyl Phthalate\u201d, or the like. It is not correct to omit all mention of diluent. If the alcoholic extracts are prepared \u201ccold\u201d (i.e. room temperature), and the mixed extracts are not evaporated, one may obtain a concentrated Tincture of Myrrh. Starting with 20 parts of crude myrrh, and ending up with 100 parts of alcoholic extract, it is customary to label the product \u201cMyrrh Tincture, 20%\u201d. Myrrh Absolute is a very dark reddish-brown or orange-colored, viscous mass, only slightly more plastic than the resinoid. The absolute, if free from solvents or plasticizers, is not pourable, but it should be soft and sticky at room temperature. Its content of essential oil may be as high as 18 to 20%, in rare cases, higher. A true and purified Absolute of Myrrh can be produced by hot extraction (reflux) of the comminuted myrrh with a hydrocarbon solvent. A resinoid is prepared by evaporation of this extract. If the hydrocarbon extract is washed free from resin-acids with weak aqueous alkali prior to evaporation, a neutral resinoid is produced. This may subsequently be extracted with hot alcohol to produce a \u201cpurified\u201d absolute. The yield is significantly smaller than the yield by ordinary and total extraction, but the product is superior in respect to odor and performance in soaps, etc. The purified absolutes are generally lighter of color. Myrrh Absolute or concentrated Myrrh Extracts are used in perfumery in circumstances similar to those described under Myrrh Resinoid. They have a lower acid index and slightly higher essential oil content than the resinoids, and they are soluble in all perfumery materials.",

Myrrh Resinoid is a very dark, reddish-orange- brown, viscous mass, hardly pourable at ordinary room temperature. It is soft and sticky, however, unless essential oil has been removed from the myrrh prior to the extraction. This is one way of producing a low-grade myrrh resinoid. The odor is intensely warm, deep-spicy, balsamic-aromatic and very rich. The resinoid is distinguished by its bitter taste as opposed to the flavor of Opopanax extracts. In spite of its intense color which is a drawback, Myrrh Resinoid finds use in perfumery as an excellent fixative and sweetener in Oriental-spicy bases, chypres, woody bases, forest notes, pine fragrances, etc. ",

There is a distinct difference between the two French types of narcissus absolute: \u201cdes plaines\u201d which is orange-colored, very viscous, and has a floral-sweet, mild and rich, but not very powerful odor.

Wormeaten nutmegs are thus easier to distil, but they may\u2014by their poor appearance\u2014indirectly tell the buyer that they could be old and poorly stored nutmegs.

The dried finger-like, husk-like arillode which surrounds the nutmeg (seed) inside the shell of the fruit is known commercially as Mace. Perfumers no longer discriminate between the essential oil from mace and that from nutmeg. Perfumers do distinguish, however, between the nutmeg oil from East Indian nutmeg and that from West Indian nutmeg. The former is generally preferred for its higher aromatic value, better solubility in ethyl alcohol and for its richer body. When they are freshly distilled the two oils have a peculiar \u201crubberlike\u201d topnote due to certain low-boiling terpenes. This odor settles down and vanishes after a few months of ageing or after proper, thorough airing of the oils. Nutmeg Oil is a pale yellow or almost water- white mobile oil of a light, fresh, warm-spicy and aromatic odor, a distinctly terpeney topnote and a rich, sweet-spicy, warm bodynote. The undertone and dryout is somewhat woody, but remains warm and sweet in good oils. There is some similarity to the odor of sweet marjoram oil. The oil has found increasing use in perfumery lately for the modern \u201cspicy\u201d perfumes and for \u201cmen\u2019s fragrances\u201d in after-shaves and other lotions. Small additions in fantasy bouquets or aldehydic perfumes, florals, chypres, etc., can have very interesting effects.",

        "background_info": "Oakmoss products are used extensively in perfumery. They form important parts of the notes in all foug\u00e8re, chypre or \u201cmoss\u201d perfumes, and they are common ingredients in colognes, cr\u00eape de Chines, forest notes, new mown hay, pine fragrances, lavender bouquets, Oriental bases, fancy or modern bases, etc. They can lend body and naturalness, rich pleasant undertones and high fixative value in numerous types of floral fragrances as well. Oakmoss products blend well with so many groups of perfume materials that it is hard to confine its use to certain mixtures. The oakmoss product never amounts to many percent of the total weight of a perfume formula (except in very rare cases), but it very often plays a decisive role in the overall performance of the perfume, even when the oakmoss product amounts to a few percent or less by weight. 1. The Concr\u00e8tes are usually restricted in use in colored soaps, unless the oakmoss concr\u00e8te is used in very low concentration in the soap perfume. Partially decolorized oakmoss concr\u00e8tes can offer some advantages at this point, but they rarely produce the same odor type as do the corresponding green extracts. It is interesting to note that, although oakmoss owes its odor to aldehydes and phenolic and acidic types of components, it can still produce a unique and inimitable effect in a soap which is an alkaline medium and in the presence of moisture.\n2. The Absolutes are the most versatile in perfumery use. Their solubility and great power make them the most popular forms of oakmoss extract. The absolute from benzene extraction is very dark green, viscous or semi-solid, while the absolute from petroleum ether extracted concr\u00e8te is liquid and brownish-green, less intense in color. Furthermore, most oakmoss products are, in reality, mixtures of oakmoss and treemoss products, the latter being less green in color, but also different in odor and less aromatic than true oakmoss. 3. Absolute Co-Distillates represent the absolute in a more or less diluted form and in various odor types according to the starting material. Anhydrol Oakmoss is a specialty of this type. It is produced by high-vacuum co-distillation of oakmoss extract with a high-boiling, odorless solvent which is miscible with perfume materials. Molecular distillation is usually applied, and the finished product contains a certain amount of the solvent. These products are almost colorless and they represent certain volatile fractions of the oakmoss fragrance. Their fixative value is inferior to that of oak- moss absolute by far. Oakmoss absolute codistillates are used where good solubility, no color and no typical moss effects is wanted. They are versatile in use and reasonable in cost, but not very typical of oakmoss in odor type. 4. Absolute Oils are the highest possible concentrations of the volatile part of oakmoss extracts. They are used in certain high-cost lotion perfumes where they may impart the most true-to-nature \u201cmoss\u201d note without contributing any color at all to the perfume. The absolute oil can be used as a trace additive for topnote effects, or it may constitute a significant part of the body and the dryout notes at higher concentration in the perfume. In odor effect, it is at least twice as powerful as the ordinary absolute.\n5. Resins are dark and often poorly soluble products. They may contain a significant amount of viscous, odorless solvent (up to two-thirds of the so-called Oakmoss Resin) and they are frequently bouquetted with coumarin, deertongue, hydroquinone dimethylether, isobutyl quinoline, clove bud oil, various residues from essential oils, etc. The actual amount of true oakmoss (or treemoss) extract in the so- called oakmoss resin may be as low as 10%. The \u201cresins\u201d are used extensively in industrial perfumes, low-cost soap perfumes, etc. Certain manufacturers know how to make an attractive \u201cresin\u201d, others just don\u2019t. Oakmoss resins are excellent fixatives for pine fragrances, low-cost foug\u00e8res, etc. but they may be insoluble in alcohol. Certain types of oakmoss resin are soluble in mineral oil. These are used in hair preparations, etc.\n6. Resinoids\u2014so-called. The use is similar to that of the \u201cresin\u201d. However, the hot-alcohol extracted \u201cresinoids\u201d represent a special type of oakmoss products. Natural extracts of oakmoss contain very little resin. Methyl abietate or abietic alcohols, etc. may be added to produce a \u201cresinous product\u201d. Oakmoss resinoids are used in soap perfumes and other perfumes where alcohol insolubility and intense color are no serious drawbacks.\n7. Decolorized Oakmoss Absolutes are usually amber-colored, pale olive or straw yellow colored liquids. There is a certain loss of odor and change in odor type by the process of decolorizing the green extracts. The decolorized products are used mainly in cases where color is a problem, where a green color must not appear (to be revealing!), or in high-cost soap perfumes for white soaps. Their particular odor and outstanding power make them interesting for modified oakmoss notes. They are usually higher in cost, by far, than the parent green extracts.",

These products are not replacements for oak- moss absolutes, nor for the essential oil of oak- moss since few or none of them have this type of odor. Rather, they are new types of oakmoss products, offered with the advantage of great solubility, no color, comparatively great strength, uniform quality, and a reasonable cost compared to that of pure oil of oakmoss.

The concr\u00e8te is not clearly soluble in alcohol, but it has very great fixative value and is of comparatively low cost due to the simple one-step processing. The bulk of all oakmoss concr\u00e8tes, however, are used for further processing into absolutes, etc. Oakmoss Concr\u00e8te (petroleum ether extract) is a viscous, brownish-green liquid whose color is much less intense than that of the benzene concr\u00e8te.

It is true, however, that olibanum of excellent appearance (which is often preferred for Incense or Frankincense in Catholic churches) may not be a very good starting material for the distillation of essential oil. There is no strict correlation between color and perfumery value of olibanum. Olibanum Oil is a mobile liquid, pale yellow or pale amber-greenish in color.

Its odor is sweet-aromatic, reminiscent of spicy soups (a faint resemblance to celery or lovage), a sweet- woody undertone and a peculiar, animal-like, also sweet and root-like note. Although to a certain degree reminiscent of myrrh, the typical difference is that opopanax has a spicy (soup-like) and an animal, root-like note, neither of which is hardly, if at all, distinguishable in myrrh. A test distillation of suspicious-looking lumps will immediately reveal to the experienced perfumer whether the lump is myrrh or opopanax. The difference in odor of the two essential oils is wide.

Opopanax Resinoid can be prepared by extraction of the crude botanical material with benzene, petroleum ether or other hydrocarbons, occasionally with solvents such as dichloro methane (methylene dichloride) or trichloro ethylene. If ethyl alcohol is used directly, a so-called alcoholresinoid or \u201cresin-absolute\u201d is produced. Opopanax Resinoid is a popular fixative in high-class perfumery, if and where its dark color is no drawback. Its warm, powdery, Oriental and spicy effect is utilized in countless combination- fixatives for forest-notes, moss-notes, Oriental bases, \u201cpowder\u201d type perfumes, spice fragrances, heavy florals, etc.",

Orange Flower Absolute is a dark brown or dark orange colored, somewhat viscous liquid with a very intensely floral, heavy and rich, warm, but also delicate and fresh, long-lasting odor, closely resembling the odor of fresh bitter-orange blossoms. Although this absolute certainly has notes in common with jasmin absolute, it has a much more versatile application as a floral \u201cfond\u201d when used at a comparatively low concentration. It shows a pleasant, but peculiar and characteristic, sweet-herbaceous undertone, not unlike the one found in jasmin. Orange flower absolute is only slightly cheaper than jasmin absolute, and it may not always impart the same floral strength as jasmin at a similar concentration. But its great advantage is in its freshness which is quite surprising considering that it is an extract with great tenacity. Neroli oil will produce a beautiful \u201cpair\u201d with orange flower absolute. The two products represent altogether different parts of the orange flower fragrance gamut. Orange Flower Absolute is used in countless types of perfumes, heavy Oriental as well as light citrus colognes, chypres and ambres as well as floral bouquets, modern aldehydic fantasy blends, etc. The absolute forms excellent combinations with all citrus oils, petitgrain oils, linalool, linalyl acetate, linalyl cinnamate, methyl anthranilate, various jasmones, myrrh resinoid, etc. It naturally forms an important part of the fixative base in high-class citrus colognes and perfumes of similar type. Orange flower absolute is used in flavors as a very universal \u201cbouquet\u201d material with delightful effects in many types of fruit flavor and even in peppermint or spearmint flavor. It generally masks or rounds off the sharp notes arising from synthetic flavor materials. Often mere traces are necessary to obtain the \u201cbouquetting\u201d effect. ",

More correctly, the total oil in the flower is \u201cextracted\u201d with water during the distillation, the most water-soluble components going into solution while the less water-soluble components will preferably remain in the separated neroli oil.

Like most other citrus fruits, the bitter orange exists in numerous varieties, and bitter orange oil varies considerably in odor and flavor according to its geographical origin. After expression of the oil by hand or by machine, some producers submit the peels to steam distillation, thus obtaining a further, small yield of a very poor oil.

A number of varieties of Pandanus species are cultivated in the tropics for many and different reasons: it forms a good fence around the house and it does not grow high or shady. The leaves are useful for thatched roofs on native huts, etc. For the perfume industry, the flowers of pandanus odoratissimus are highly interesting and very unusual. Not only are the flowers unusually large (single flowers weighing 165 grams are not uncommon), but they are powerfully fragrant with a very characteristic perfume. Accordingly, the creamy-white flowers have attracted the interest of the perfume industry in certain tropical areas where the plant grows abundantly and where extraction facilities are at hand. The flowers can be steam distilled without the addition of other essential oils and with no diluent oil in the receiver, but the extremely small yield makes it necessary to use some sort of a solvent in the receptacle in order to avoid excessive loss of oil. The oil is somewhat soluble in water. The most economic method, and the most common large-scale method today is the hydrocarbon extraction method in which a concr\u00e8te is first prepared. By alcohol washing of the concr\u00e8te an Absolute of Pandanus is obtained. The oil or the absolute is particularly interesting for the perfume chemist since the main constituent is about 75% of Methyl-beta-Phenylethyl Ether. Pandanus Absolute is a colorless liquid of intensely sharp, very powerful and diffusive, but also very sweet, hyacinth-honeylike odor. It is easier to evaluate this odor in dilutions below one percent. The powerful topnote is of very short duration, leaving only a faint, sweet-floral and fresh tone-out fragrance on a perfume blotter. The absolute blends well with styrax resinoid, cinnamic alcohol, amyl salicylate, phenylethyl phenylacetate, ar-methyl-phenylethyl alcohol, indole, heliotropine, galbanum resinoid, sage clary, bergamot, terpineol, linalool, ylang-ylang, etc. If properly fixed (and this is difficult!), the pandanus absolute can be of great interest to the perfumer in compositions such as honeysuckle, hyacinth, lily, narcissus, etc. and for experimental modifications of rose, lilac, etc.",

Accordingly, the use of parsley seed oil in perfumery is restricted to such fragrances where a warm-spicy effect is called for: Oriental bases, chypres, \u201cmen\u2019s fragrances\u201d, colognes, certain modern fantasy perfumes, etc. The oil is also used in certain types of rose and orange flower bases.

        "background_info": "This very important perfume oil is produced by steam distillation of the dried leaves of Pogostemon Cablin (also known as Pogostemon Patchouli), a small plant which probably originated in the Philippine Islands and Indonesia where the bulk of today\u2019s patchouli oil still is produced. In order to get a full yield of the essential oil by steam distillation, it is necessary to rupture the cell walls in the leaf material prior to distillation. This can be performed by controlled, light fermentation, by scalding with superheated steam (like the \u201cblanching\u201d process of vegetables before canning), or by stacking or baling the dried leaves, thus \u201ccuring\u201d them by modest and interrupted fermentation. If carried out properly, the latter method yields the best perfume oil. Patchouli Oil (native distilled) is a dark orange or brownish-colored, viscous liquid, possessing an extremely rich, sweet-herbaceous, aromatic- spicy and woody-balsamic odor. An almost wine- like, ethereal-floral sweetness in the initial notes is characteristic of good oils although this topnote can be absent or masked in freshly distilled, otherwise good oils. The odor should remain sweet through all stages of evaporation. Patchouli oil will remain perceptible on a perfume blotter for weeks or months, and the sweetness is almost sickening in high concentration. Dry or tarlike notes should not be perceptible throughout the first hours of study of the oil on a blotter, and cade-like, dry cedarwoodlike odor which may appear in the topnote should rapidly vanish and give way to the rich sweetness. Thus, it remains a \u201cmatter of opinion\u201d what type of patchouli oil is \u201cgood\u201d and what type is \u201cpoor\u201d. Many perfumers have never\u2014or rarely\u2014smelled other types than the dry, phenolic, cade-like type. This type may be their standard of evaluation, or they may actually like to use this type. In both cases it can be said that the bodynotes of patchouli oil should display an outstanding richness, a root-like note with a delicate earthiness which should not include \u201cmold-like\u201d or musty-dry notes. The odor of patchouli oil is often described as \u201cminty\u201d, \u201cswampy\u201d, \u201cbarnyard-like\u201d, etc. and there is no doubt that the many types confuse the unexperienced evaluator. Tenacity in odor is one of the typical virtues of patchouli oil, and is one of the reasons for its versatile use. European or American distilled patchouli oil is a pale orange or amber-colored, viscous liquid of very sweet, rich, spicy-aromatic and herbaceous odor; it bears an overall resemblance to the odor of the native oil, but has a pronounced topnote of fruity, wine-like sweetness, and less pronounced woody-earthy notes. The odor is often more spicybalsamic and usually more tenacious than that of the native oil. Certain distillers in Europe and at one time in the U. S. A., too, have a reputation for special know-how in the distilling of patchouli. In all cases, whether it is of native or European- American distillation, the odor of the oil improves significantly upon ageing. The sharp-green or \u201cwet-earthy\u201d, minty notes are subdued or vanish, and the sweet fess rises to the surface of the odor pattern. It forms an important ingredient in Oriental bases, woody bases, foug\u00e8res, chypres, opopanax bases, powder-type perfumes, etc. It is an excellent masking agent for depilatory creams, e.g. in combination with orange type materials.

        "background_info": "Balsam Peru, also called Peruvian Balsam, is a true natural resinous balsam. It consists of essential oil and resin, and is thus of the oleo-resin type. The essential oil consists mainly of high-boiling esters of benzoic and cinnamic acids, forming the balsamic part of the natural product. Peru Balsam is a pathological product which exudes from the trunk of the large Central American tree, Myroxylon Pereirae, when the bark is removed section wise from the tree. The exudation is collected in a very crude manner, and is only coarsely purified locally by treatment with boiling water. In order to increase the yield of balsam, the native collectors use knives, hatchets or even blowtorches on the bark and the lacerated trunk. The latter sort of treatment may introduce a pronounced \u201csmoky\u201d note in the Peru balsam. Due to the primitive conditions of the purification process, the balsam may acquire a smoky note anyway, namely from the fire over which the water has been boiled with the balsam separating at the bottom. The odor is the typical \u201cbalsamic\u201d one: rich, sweet, cinnamic-benzoic, soft and very tenacious, showing an increasing vanillin-like note on drying out. Incidentally, the balsam does not truly \u201cdry out\u201d when exposed to the air. If Peru balsam is spilled outside the bottle and not wiped off, the bottle will remain oily, not sticky or stringy. The flavor of the balsam is persistently bitter, warm and biting, not at all as suave or pleasant as its odor. Peru balsam is almost entirely soluble in perfume alcohol, but only partly soluble in petroleum ether or other hydrocarbons. Peru Balsam is often used as such in perfumery since the natural resins act as good fixatives. However, the very dark color of the natural product is a disadvantage in many cases. In addition, the insolubility of certain constituents of Peru balsam in other perfume materials presents difficulties. This may cause resins to deposit slowly from the perfume, giving it a poor appearance, or clogging the nozzle of an aerosol can, or making trouble in other ways. However, the oil or the resin-free preparations from the balsam find a more extensive use in modern perfumery.",

        "background_info": "When Peru balsam is steam distilled, it gives a very poor yield of essential oil. This is partly due to the high boiling points of the oil constituents of Peru balsam, partly due to the unfavorable ratio in the binary mixtures of water (steam) and the individual oil-constituents when steam distillation is applied. Until good and efficient, high-vacuum stills were developed, various so-called Peru balsam oils were available: alcohol extracts, co-distillates, anhydrols, etc. Some of these were water-white, and these products usually diverged considerably from the natural balsam in odor type. An almost \u201ctotal\u201d oil of Peru balsam is prepared today by several manufacturers who distil the balsam in medium-sized, all-glass vacuum stills at about 2 mm. Hg.-pressure or lower. The heat source may be electrical pads or oil-baths, glycol-baths, etc. The latter type has the advantage of perfect control with the \u201cskin\u201d-temperature which should not exceed 120\u00b0C. In order to distil completely at this maximum temperature, it will be necessary to work at pressures below 1 mm. Hg. The main components of Peru balsam oil distil at about 120\u00b0 to 135\u00b0 at 2\u20143 mm. Hg. This distillation temperature demands a \u201cpot\u201d temperature of about 145\u00b0C. even when the distillation is carried out with little or no column. At this temperature, dust and other mechanical impurities in the Peru balsam will start charring and decomposing, thus causing an unnatural increase in the \u201csmoky\u201d notes of the distilled oil. A molecular still is in its principle a still without a \u201cpot\u201d: the material leaves the heated surface only to move as a vapor over in the condenser and receiver. The balsam can be co-distilled with various odorless solvents which protect the balsam and its oil against superheating. Anhydrol Balsam Peru is a molecular distillate of this type. Some of its constituents are solid and a true, total oil of Peru balsam is semi-solid at room temperature. It is a pale yellow or pale amber-colored mass of white crystals in a viscous yellowish colored liquid. The odor is truly balsamic, rich, deep-sweet, slightly spicy and vanillin-sweet. A distinct smoky undertone is natural, but should not be predominant, and may fade away after proper ageing of the oil. The tenacity in odor of this oil is outstanding, making it one of the best fixatives among all essential oils. Its suave odor makes Peru balsam oil a very versatile perfume material which can be incorporated in almost any type of perfume base or perfume at concentrations of from less than one percent up to more than five percent. For delicate floral fragrances such as muguet, lilac, apple blossom, etc., this oil blends excellently with floral as well as with balsamic or spicy notes. With araucaria oil or sandalwood oil it blends to a delightfully sweet \u201cprecious wood\u201d type like cabreuva oil. In gardenia, longoza, tuberose and carnation bases or duplications it forms an important part of the long-lasting, sweet undertone with undecanolide, nonanolide, ylang-ylang and other heavy and sweet-floral notes. It imparts depth and natural spicy sweetness to a rose, and warm, balsamic body in ambre or Oriental bases, \u201cpowder\u201d type fragrances, etc. ",

        "background_info": "Pimenta berry, better known as \u201cAllspice\u201d, is a popular household spice, and the layman who is familiar with the odor of all-spice would certainly recognize this odor in pimenta berry oil. The leaf oil, however, would not be identified as \u201callspice\u201d by the average housewife or cook. Pimenta Berry Oil is steam distilled from dried, crushed, fully grown, but unripe fruits of the West Indian tree, Pimenta Officinalis. Pimenta Berry Oil is a pale yellow liquid with a warm-spicy, sweet odor, presenting a peculiar, but fresh and clean topnote and a long-lasting, sweet, balsamic-spicy bodynote with a tea-like undertone. There is a certain resemblance to clove bud oil in the slightly sour-fresh, fruity topnote. Any dryness in the odor, any lack of sweet freshness and dullness of the dryout, should arouse the suspicion of the evaluator. In perfumery, the role of pimenta berry oil is limited to that of a modifier in the modern \u201cspicy\u201d types of \u201cmen\u2019s fragrance\u201d, foug\u00e8re, after-shave, etc. and occasionally as a \u201cspecial note\u201d of warm and sweet-spicy character, e.g. in chypre, Oriental bases, etc. ",

Further experiments are, however, now being carried out in India of the flowers of Plumeria Acutifolia, and in China on the flowers of other species (see following monograph). It is possible that petroleum ether extracts (concr\u00e8tes) and absolutes may become available in the near future.

Most often, an alcohol-extract of the oleo-resin is produced, or a concentrated tincture prepared directly with alcohol from the leafbuds is used. The essential oil is not commercially available, but the leaf buds are, and so are various extracts from this material. Balsam Poplar Oleoresin is a viscous, dark brown or dark amber colored liquid of very sweet balsamic coumarinic-cinnamic odor, with a peculiar undertone reminiscent of labdanum extracts. There is a distinct note in alcoholic extracts, reminding one of hop absolute or valerian, but the overall odor is strongly balsamic.

These will inevitably include various amounts of foliage from the top of the plant, contributing significantly to the peculiar green note in the odor complex of the absolute. The absolute is prepared by alcohol washing of the concr\u00e8te. The yield of absolute is about 0.06% calculated upon the weight of dried flower material. Obviously, this absolute is expensive. Today, the annual production of Reseda Flower Absolute can be measured in grammes, rather than kilos. It hardly exceeds 5 kilos in France which is the main producer. Reseda Flower Absolute is a very dark, orange or olive-brown colored viscous liquid which solidifies to a paste slightly below room temperature. The odor is intensely herbaceous-green, with a sweet, watercress-like undertone, and not at all sharp.

A few French and overseas houses, however, have agreements with the Bulgarian producers who will process certain amounts of the Bulgarian concr\u00e8te to an absolute according to specifications from these customers. Rose absolute is an orange-yellow, orange- reddish or slightly olive-yellowish colored, viscous liquid of extremely rich, warm, spicy-floral and very deep rose odor with a more or less pronounced honeylike undertone. Its diffusive power is only realized when the absolute is diluted or used at the concentration of a few percent or even less in a perfume base. Bulgarian Rose Absolute is used so extensively in high-class perfumes that it is hardly possible to define its field of application. Apart from strictly rosy florals, it forms important parts of the conventional rose-jasmin complex which is found in countless fashion perfumes today. It is used in cassie modifications, carnation bases, chypres, Oriental bases, modern fantasy bouquets, etc. Its unusual radiation compensates for its high cost to a certain degree, so that it can be used in medium priced perfumes as well.

        "background_info": "The Moroccan rose, presumably a local variety of Rosa Centifolia, produces a wealth of flowers and is excellent for the extraction of perfume by solvent. The yield of essential oil by steam or water + steam distillation is, however, rather small, and the oil has not attained much popularity among the perfumers until very recently. Moroccan rose oil is a pale yellow or almost colorless liquid, with a deep-sweet, rich and tenacious floral rose-odor. The peculiar \u201cspicy\u201d undertone found in Bulgarian oil seems to be missing or slightly weaker in the Moroccan oil. The warmth is equal to that of the Bulgarian oil. Overall, the performance of the Moroccan oil shows only a slight deficiency in power, richness and piquancy compared to that of the Bulgarian oil. But the present quality of Moroccan rose oil is a vast improvement over the oil which was occasionally produced in Morocco 20 or more years ago. Moroccan rose oil finds increasing areas of application in perfumery where its delightful fragrance adds life, depth, warm notes and naturalness to countless floral and non-floral perfumes, in addition to its use in rose and related bases.

        "background_info": "The so-called \u201cotto of rose\u201d is the essential oil, steam distilled from the flowers of Rosa Damascena. In Bulgaria, water distillation is also carried out, but all stills are of comparatively modern design. The rose flowers are distilled quickly after harvesting, and the distillation demands considerable experience. It is common practise to redistil the distillation waters (cohobation process), and to bulk the oils from the two distillations. The yield of cohobation oil is several times higher than that from the first (direct) distillation of the flowering material. The phenylethyl alcohol in \u201cOtto of rose\u201d is derived almost exclusively from the cohobation water. Bulgarian \u201cotto of rose\u201d is a pale yellow or slightly olive-yellow liquid which separates white or colorless blades of crystals (the so-called stearopten) at temperatures below 21\u00b0C. When further cooled, the oil may solidify to a translucent mass, the crystals growing from the surface due to their lower specific gravity. The odorless stearopten amounts to 16 to 22% of the rose oil. The liquid portion is known as the elaeopten. The odor of Bulgarian rose oil is warm, deep- floral, slightly spicy and immensely rich, truly reminiscent of red roses, often with nuances in the spicy and honeylike notes. Bulgarian rose oil is used so extensively that its high cost is almost the only limitation on its use in perfumery. Even traces, fractions of one percent of this oil in many types of perfume bases, can do wonders when correctly used. Carnation is one example of this. ",

Steam distillation of the dried botanical material yields extremely little essential oil (see below). However, the Saffron Oil has been known for more than a century, presumably because of the interest in the botanical material since time immemorial. Saffron Oil is not commercially available. A tincture of saffron is usually produced by the consumer according to his needs. By petroleum ether extraction of saffron and subsequent decomposition of the glycosidic extract with lukewarm water, the aldehyde is liberated. An essential oil can be produced directly from the saffron by water distillation in carbon dioxide atmosphere. The oil is pale yellow, mobile and possesses a fresh, strong odor, recalling that of the botanical material. However, the essential oil is extremely unstable. It is advantageous to prepare a concentrated tincture from saffron with diluted alcohol under gentle heating (infusion-tincture). A 20 % tincture will serve most perfumery and flavor purposes since the penetrative strength of this material is easily underestimated. Minute additions to violet perfumes, narcissus or even neroli bases can produce quite beautiful results, unobtainable by other means.",

        "background_info": "Clary Sage Absolute is produced from Clary Sage Concr\u00e8te. The concr\u00e8te is produced from the clary sage plant by extraction with petroleum ether. As a rule, either flowering tops or tops whose flowers have withered and produced seed are used for extraction. Leaves and stalks are avoided if possible. This may be part of the reason for the six to eight times higher yield by extraction than by steam distillation. Another reason is that non-volatile odorous and non-odorous matter is extracted but cannot be steam distilled. Clary Sage Concr\u00e8te is a solid mass of green to pale olive-green color and an extremely rich, delicately sweet, yet bitter-winy and somewhat herbaceous odor of great tenacity. The slightly bitter undertone is utilized with good results in ambre perfume bases, while the rich and sweet body blends extremely well with citrus colognes, lavender foug\u00e8res, chypres, etc. The concr\u00e8te is occasionally used as such in high grade soap perfumes, etc., where high fixative power is imperative. Although poorly soluble in alcohol, the concr\u00e8te is clearly miscible with most perfume materials, and it finds increasing use in modern perfumery, e.g. for aldehydic perfumes, foug\u00e8re bases, chypres, colognes, after-shave lotion perfumes, ambre bases, etc. The odor of the absolute closely resembles that of the concr\u00e8te, but there is a perceptible difference in the intensity of the odor of the two materials. The absolute has a somewhat finer, less resinous odor, more balsamic-sweet than the odor of the concr\u00e8te. Clary Sage Absolute is an extremely interesting perfume material and, since the yield is three to four times the yield of essential oil by steam distillation, the absolute can be produced at a very attractive price, and the demand for this material increases steadily. Clary Sage Absolute is an excellent modifier, fixative and natural \u201cbody\u201d for colognes, lavender foug\u00e8res, chypres, ambre bases, conifer fragrances,, forest notes and even floral notes like muguet and jasmin.

The oil is occasionally rectified further in Australia prior to shipping. Australasian Sandalwood Oil is a pale yellow viscous liquid whose odor is soft, woody, extremely tenacious and somewhat balsamic in its delicate sweetness. Its topnote is distinctly different from that of the East Indian sandalwood oil, not sweet but rather dry-bitter, slightly resinous like myrrh oil, although not very pronounced. On drying out, the odor slowly becomes very similar to that of the East Indian oil. Apart from this characteristic topnote, there is very little difference in the overall odor between the East Indian oil and the Australasian oil. Redistilled Australasian sandalwood oil competes favorably with commercial grades of East Indian sandalwood oil. Australasian Sandalwood Oil is used mainly as a replacement for East Indian sandalwood oil although the price difference is not very great. The Australasian oil is very suitable for the isolation of santalol, the main constituent. Australasian Sandalwood Oil is also used in perfumery for its balsamic-woody notes and great tenacity (fixative value). Its characteristic topnote often makes it unsuitable for direct replacement of the East Indian oil. ",

It is believed that the oil of sandalwood was known in Ceylon over 1000 years ago, but it is only within the past century that the oil has appeared in European and American perfumery. The oil is steam distilled or water distilled from the coarsely powdered wood of billets and roots of Santalum Album, a comparatively small tree. A sandalwood tree must be over 30 years old before its wood is suitable for distillation. Comminuting of the wood is not an easy job (3 progressive steps often required: sawing or cleaving, chopping, grinding), and the distillation also requires considerable experience, many hours of operation per batch, large amounts of steam or heating of the water, etc. For such reasons, it is understandable that the cultivation of the tree has remained an Indian tradition through thousands of years. East Indian Sandalwood Oil is a pale yellow to yellow, viscous liquid, having an extremely soft, sweet-woody and almost animal-balsamic odor, presenting little or no particular topnote, and remaining uniform for a considerable length of time due to its outstanding tenacity. It is almost a common \u201cblender\u201d-fixative in countless woody-floral and Oriental-floral bases, chypres, foug\u00e8res, clover, carnation, origan-types and other perfume type. Furthermore, the oil is used as a base for co-distillation of other essential oils, e.g. the most delicate florals: rose, mimusops elengi, anthocephalus cadamba, pandanus, etc. In India, the so-called \u201cattars\u201d are made with sandalwood oil distilled over such flowers, or by distillation of these flowers into a receiver with sandalwood oil. As a background note and sweet fixative in ambre perfumes, in opopanax and \u201cprecious wood\u201d types, it is almost obligatory. ",

The resin is obtained only by incisions in the trunk and branches, whereby the viscous sandarac flows out and quickly solidifies when exposed to the air. Native people then peel off the small tear-shaped, pale yellow resin drops. The main part of all sandarac is used in fine lacquers, varnishes (also medicinal), while small amounts are used in perfumery as a fixative in woody perfumes, pine fragrances, incense or Oriental bases, etc. The essential oil can be obtained either by steam distillation directly on the resin (usual method), or, the resin acids being soluble in aqueous potassium hydroxide, it is possible to isolate the essential oil from a neutralized alcoholic solution of sandarac. The alcohol is evaporated, and the alkaline solution is extracted with ethyl ether. After removal of the ether, a small amount of essential oil is left, unharmed by the exposure to high distillation temperatures. This method has hitherto had only theoretical interest, and there is, all told, very little interest in the essential oil of Sandarac. Sandarac Oil is a pale yellow or almost colorless mobile liquid of a turpentine-like, fresh-resinous and slightly balsamic odor.

And when perfumers generally are looking for a \u201cmarine\u201d or \u201cseashore\u201d type of odor, they will often turn to ambergris, nerol, geraniol, iodinecomplexes, ozone-notes, etc. However, several different extracts of seaweed are common commercial articles in the pharmaceutical industry: e. g. the extract of Fucus Vesiculosus (the bladder seaweed) which is a mild laxative. The brown algae Dictyota Dichotoma which is quite common in Scandinavian waters has, when dry, a typical \u201cseashore\u201d odor. In Ireland, certain seaweeds are collected along with the harvesting of Carragheen (Irish moss) which is itself occasionally extracted for perfumery purposes. No doubt, the typical notes of seaweed will remind the perfumer of iodine, nerol, cresol, furfural, cymene, ambergris, etc. Some of the above algae or seaweeds have been submitted to steam distillation and yielded essential oils. So-called Seaweed Absolute is often a deepgreen or greenish-brown liquid (petroleum ether extracted) of intensely green-herbaceous, phenolic-woody and \u201cdry\u201d odor type, distinctly recalling the odor of seaweed drying on a salt water beach after a heavy storm or surf. Seaweed Absolute is an extremely powerful perfume material. Its penetrative effect is partly due to its unusual type of odor. It finds use in mossy-woody, herbaceous, aldehydic or \u201cgreen\u201d perfume types, or in fantasy bases, etc. ",

The name Liquidambar is derived from the French \u201cliquid ambre\u201d. The tree is wildgrowing, and does not have to be felled in order to yield styrax. The bark is removed spotwise, and the sapwood is deliberately injured. Styrax is formed and collected in cans below the wounds or scraped off the wound. The peeled bark can be boiled in water to yield an additional amount of styrax. The entire yield is \u201ccleaned\u201d by washing in boiling water. The water is decanted, and the heavier styrax collected on hairsifts or linen filters. Asian Styrax is a very viscous or semiliquid mass of greenish-gray to brownish gray color, usually showing water on the surface and a heterogeneous semi-solid mass of darker color at the bottom of the container. The styrax itself is sticky and usually non-pourable at room temperature. The water-free portion is almost completely soluble in alcohol. It contains substantial amounts of cinnamic acid (which should be considered when styrax is used in soap perfumes). Asian styrax is rarely used as such in perfumery. Only well cleaned products or extracts are suitable for perfumes. II: American Styrax: A product similar to the above Asian styrax is produced from certain varieties of the large tree, Liquidambar Styraciflua, wild growing in the eastern and southern U. S. A., in Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala. This balsam is collected in Honduras and, to a lesser extent in Guatemala, Central America. The balsam is a pathological exudation which accumulates in \u201cpockets\u201d in older trees. Incisions in the bark or other damaging of the trees thus is not necessary. The pockets are tapped on the living trees. There is little or no cleaning operation of the collected balsam. The balsam is usually darker, but cleaner than Asian styrax. The odor of American (Honduras) styrax, however, is more \u201cgasolinelike\u201d (styrene-odor), covering the balsamic sweetness of the main ingredients of the balsam. The two products are used for quite similar purposes in perfumery. On account of the subdued styrene odor, the Asian balsam is generally preferred. However, when resinoids are prepared, the two products become almost identical since the styrene is partially or totally lost during the evaporation. Some perfumers even prefer the pronounced styrene note because of the apparent power displayed by this unsaturated hydrocarbon. ",

The topnote can be disposed of by leaving out the \u201cheads\u201d of the steam distillate but, on the other hand, many customers expect this styrene note and it also mellows in to a great extent after some time. Styrax Oil can be considered a neutral (non-acidic) concentrate of styrax balsam. It has all the floral-balsamic notes of the balsam, but none of the drawbacks from acids, water or color. It is clearly soluble in alcohol and all common perfume materials, and its comparatively low cost makes it one of the most interesting perfume materials. Styrax Oil is used in numerous types of floral perfumes, e.g. lilac, hyacinth, apple blossom, carnation, etc. In spite of its deep sweetness, its dry-floral note makes it suitable for cassie, mimosa, violet, carnation and hawthorn (spicy notes!), lavender and foug\u00e8re (sweetness and tenacity), rose, etc. ",

The flowers, occasionally the entire overground part of the plant (the herb), are distilled with steam to yield a yellowish-amber-colored essential oil which is mobile when freshly distilled, but soon oxidizes and resinifies and becomes very viscous when exposed to air and moisture. Old oils are viscous, dark amber or brownish colored, and lack the typical fruity topnote. Fresh oils are characterized by a very powerful fruity topnote, somewhat reminiscent of green apples. The body- notes are strongly herbaceous, somewhat sharp, like the non-floral part of the lavender fragrance. The oil finds use in certain types of herbaceous fragrances, e.g. foug\u00e8re, lavender, etc., and occasionally in florals such as jasmin, gardenia, chypre, violet, etc., where the herbaceous-green notes play an important role. Modern aldehydic bases, \u201ctabac\u201d-bases, etc., may also benefit from trace additions of tagetes patula oil. When the flowering tops of the tagetes patula plant are distilled into a receiver which contains a solvent, e.g. sandalwood oil or liquid paraffin, a so-called \u201cAttar Genda\u201d is obtained. ",

Red Thyme Oil is a brownish-red, orange-red or grayish-brown colored liquid, rich and powerful, sweet, and warm-herbaceous in odor, somewhat spicy and distinctly aromatic. In perfumery, the oil finds some use in soap perfumes where its power and freshness can introduce a hint of medicinal notes, often desirable in certain types of soap or detergent. The oil exerts an excellent masking effect over tarry odors and thus illustrates brilliantly an example of \u201cdistracting\u201d odor effect. Added to lotion perfumes or colognes in trace amounts, thyme oil may lend body and sweet freshness in lavenders, foug\u00e8re-colognes, citrus-colognes, spicy after- shaves, etc. The oil is highly interesting as a topnote material. Due to its phenol content (the solid phenol, Thymol), it discolors rapidly in contact with iron, even iron in trace amounts in other essential oils. Larger concentrations of thyme oil in soap perfumes may also prevent the perfume from being used in white soaps. White Thyme Oil, when correctly produced and genuine, is a pale yellow liquid similar in odor to the above-described red thyme, yet somewhat sweeter, less terpeney or sharp. It is also less herbaceous. Truly, it should be a redistilled red thyme oil. ",

The seed is removed from the ripe fruit and is dried and soaked in alcohol or rum for 12 to 24 hours. The seeds then swell and, when they are removed from the alcohol bath, they shrink on drying, and on the surface appears the well- known crystalline frosting of coumarin. This treatment is partly a curing, partly a conventional \u201csales promotion\u201d process. The customers expect this particular appearance of tonka beans although the \u201cfrosting\u201d is no criterion of high quality. Rum is used mainly because it is the cheapest form of local alcohol. Tonka Beans do not yield any appreciable amount of aromatic oil upon steam distillation, but they are extracted with various solvents to produce tinctures, concr\u00e8tes and absolutes. In order to evaluate tonka beans, it is necessary to perform a test extraction. Even if he has solid knowledge and good experience in the trade of tonka beans, it is not possible for the perfumer to judge the quality directly. Adulteration is practically out of the question when the consumer buys the whole beans. However, \u201cartificial\u201d frosting with a solution of synthetic coumarin is not an unknown sophistication. Since the tonka \u201cbean\u201d does not contain any significant amounts of resinous matter, the author prefers to use the term \u201cConcr\u00e8te\u201d for the hydrocarbon- or acetone-extracted products of the bean. Benzene, acetone, ethyl ether or petroleum ether are used in the extraction of the coarsely pulverized, dried tonka \u201cbeans\u201d. Hot extraction is not advantageous since it draws out waxes and fats which are solid at room temperature and must be eliminated anyway. Percolation gives good results. The extract is evaporated under gentle vacuum until all solvent is removed. The resulting residue is Tonka Concr\u00e8te, and its appearance varies according to the solvent used. A considerable amount of fixed (vegetable, fatty) oil is present, and the concr\u00e8te is rarely a homogeneous mass. Its color is amber to brownish yellow, and it will form a white or creamy-colored deposit of crystallized coumarin, which is present in such amounts that it is not soluble in the oil. Tonka Concr\u00e8tes are used in tobacco flavoring in countries where a coumarin ban does not exist. For perfumery, the Absolute (see this monograph) is preferred for better solubility and absence of fixed oil. Tonka Resin is a conventional term for a solid extract of tonka \u201cbeans\u201d, usually by means of benzene. The fatty oil may be eliminated, but the so-called resin still contains natural waxes. It is not infrequently adulterated with synthetic coumarin. It does not contain natural resins from tonka in any significant amount. Methyl abietate, deodorized dihydro methyl abietate, hydroabietic alcohols, Sumatra benzoin extracts, etc. may be added to tonka bean extracts to give them an appearance of \u201cresins\u201d.",

The trade offers countless types of treemoss absolutes and similar extracts, tinctures, concentrates, ultrasonic extracts, integral extracts, fractions etc. Thus, it would be impossible to give more than a very general description of the odor and appearance of treemoss absolute. Treemoss Absolute is used extensively in perfumery. In fact, this material has become one of the most important natural fixatives and odorants next to the essential oils. On the other hand, treemoss collected from firs, cedars and spruces is rarely mixed with true oakmoss. The treemoss products present the earthy-woody, dry forestnotes and part of the leather-like notes of true oakmoss. But treemoss has little or no topnote, delicate freshness or elegance. By the addition of various amounts of oakmoss to treemoss, all grades of intermediate products and qualities are obtained. An essential oil (Treemoss Oil) is obtained by molecular distillation of treemoss concr\u00e8te. Similar products are obtained by co-distillation of the concr\u00e8te with a high-boiling solvent. These products are distinguished by their pale color and good solubility. The essential oil is pale yellow or almost colorless, and usually shows a deposit of white crystal needles. The oil is the most concentrated form of the treemoss odor, but it has less fixative effect than the absolute or the concr\u00e8te. ",

The Absolute from Pommade is produced by alcohol washing of the \u201cpommade\u201d which, in turn, is prepared from the flowers by enfleurage. The flowers are picked immediately before the petals open. Finally, the Absolute from Ch\u00e2ssis is prepared by alcohol washing of a hydrocarbon extract of the \u201cspent\u201d flowers of the \u201cchassis\u201d from the enfleurage process. The tuberose plant is a tender, tall, slim perennial, Polyanthes Tuberosa, a native of Central America where wild growing species can be found. Its name refers to its bulb (it is tuberous) although this is not truly a tuber in botanical terms. It has no reference to \u201crose\u201d at all. The plant is related to the Narcissus, Jonquil and other popular garden plants. For several reasons, the most common form of tuberose absolute has always been the enfleurage product: The tuberose flower is one of the flowers which continue to produce and exhale perfume long after it has been removed from the plant. Even without this advantage, the yield of absolute from pommade is higher than the yield by solvent extraction. It is only very recently that solvent extraction has been developed to such a point of perfection that it has become economically attractive and generally practicable. Tuberose Absolute from Pommade is a soft paste or semiliquid mass of dark orange to brown color. The odor is extremely heavy-sweet, floral- honey-like with a distinct oily-fatty undertone that is partly due to the method of production.\nTuberose Absolute from Concr\u00e8te is a dark orange to brown colored, viscous liquid with a heavy floral, almost nauseatingly sweet, heavy and somewhat spicy odor, reminiscent of honeysuckle, peru balsam, orange flower absolute, ylang-ylang residue fractions, stephanotis flowers, etc. The odor also has some resemblance to that of Longoza Absolute which is probably the closest natural approach to the tuberose fragrance. Tuberose Absolute is used\u2014when available and when the cost allows for such extravagance\u2014in high-class floral perfumes of the heaviest and sweetest types: frangipanni, stephanotis, caprifolium, lilac, heliotrope, gardenia, violet, and in heavy Oriental types, opopanax, in fantasy perfumes, etc. ",

        "background_info": "One of the most intriguing and inimitable flavor and perfume materials is Vanilla. The story of vanilla is a tale in itself, and the process of curing the immature green capsules into the deliciously fragrant chocolate-brown vanilla \u201cbeans\u201d is no less fantastic. Literature is abundant on the subject of cultivating, curing and extracting vanilla, but a few brief details should be mentioned a this place. The vanilla plant is an orchid, a climbing vine that needs a supporting tree or trunk into which the vine sends tiny, but strong \u201chooks\u201d, often mistaken for suction roots. But the plant is not a parasite. It takes all its nourishment from the soil and the air directly. The vanilla flowers are hand pollinated (even in Mexico where the growers cannot expect the local insects to do a 100% effective job), and the flower produces a fruit which reaches maturity after 8 to 9 months on the plant. Immediately prior to maturity, the fruit is harvested, and the green, odorless, bitter tasting and somewhat poisonous \u201cpods\u201d now face a long and troublesome curing period, not unlike the curing of tea and tobacco. The curing leads to enzymatic processes within the fruits which slowly turn brown and become aromatic. The curing of vanilla fruits is performed locally, except in the Andapa (inland jungle) district of Madagascar where no experienced curers are at hand, although many hundreds of tons of green pods are harvested there. The fruits are air shipped to the coastal district for proper curing. After three months or more curing time, the \u201cpods\u201d (botanically the fruit is a capsule) are ready for shipment. Before being shipped, they are sorted according to length and appearance. The trend is towards a drier export material. From Madagascar and La R\u00e9union comes the so-called Bourbon Vanilla, named after the island of Bourbon (La R\u00e9union) where the curing method was developed. Mexican vanilla is also derived from Vanilla Planifolia (a hybrid of other vanilla plants), but the Mexican curing method is slightly different from the R\u00e9union curing. The Mexican vanilla is somewhat sharper or more pungent in its aroma. R\u00e9union or Bourbon Vanilla appears as chocolate-brown, semi-dry or somewhat moist, dull or glossy. 14 to 22 cm. long \u201csticks\u201d, which may be bundled in different ways according to origin, or may be sold \u201cen vrac\u201d (i.e. loose in box). The aroma is extremely rich, sweet, somewhat woody and animal (castoreum-like), tobacco-like and very deep in its balsamic, sweet-spicy body- note. Actually, the odor of vanillin is not one of the characteristics in the aroma of Bourbon vanilla. However, the odor varies considerably according to the moisture content of the fruits; thus, the odor of very moist fruits is usually more to the vanillin side. The drier the fruits become, the more perceptible is the odor of the non-steam- volatile, high-boiling aromatic principles. Tahiti Vanilla is generally shorter in length and mostly a bundled, moist fruit. Its odor is almost perfumery-sweet, not tobacco-like, not very deep or woody, nor distinctly animal. Some people find it more attractive, perhaps because it reminds them more of the everyday (artificial) vanilla flavors in ice-cream, candies and baked goods. A certain type of Guadeloupe Vanilla is called \u201cVanillons\u201d and the fruits are derived from Vanilla Pompona, a different species of vanilla. The fruits are short (8 to 14 cms.) and wide (up to 2 \u00bd cm. flat measure). They have a peculiar floral-sweet fragrance of the anisic, heliotropineisosafrol type, and are more perfumery than all other vanilla types. Vanillons are considered poor quality vanilla for flavoring purposes. ",

        "background_info": "Under the monographs of Vanilla Absolute, Vanilla \u201cResinoid\u201d and Vanilla Tincture, it is mentioned that a hydro-alcoholic extraction of the cured vanilla fruits is the method that yields the best and richest extract from an odor-flavor point of view. It is quite possible that, during the treatment with hot ethyl alcohol and water, certain chemical processes take place among the components of vanilla (transesterification, hydrolysis, etc.). Since the cured vanilla contains some oily and resinous matter, the most practical method of total extraction is the following: The vanilla is extracted once with petroleum ether or dichioromethane. This extract is evaporated per se, and kept separate till later. Extraction is then continued with 70% ethyl alcohol, then with 60% alcohol, with 50% alcohol and perhaps with 40% or 30% alcohol. Finally, one extract is made with hot, distilled water. The alcoholic extractions are carried out under one hour reflux, or they may be simple percolations. The water extraction is usually a percolation whereby adherent alcohol is flushed out of the exhaust plant material. The combined extracts are evaporated gently. Towards the end of alcohol take-off, propylene glycol is added to the extract so that the water can be distilled off under gentle vacuum (pot temperature about 40\u00b0C.). It is adviseable to extract the distillation water with petroleum ether since traces of delicate aromatic matter are steam distilled with the water. By weighing the completely exhausted and dried vanilla, it is possible to calculate the exact amount of non-aqueous extracted matter. The water content in the vanilla fruits prior to extraction must be determined in advance. Thus, it is possible to add exactly the right amount of propylene glycol so that the resulting extract is e.g. 1 = 1. At this point, the first petroleum ether extract is added or an alcohol extract from it is prepared and added. The extract from the distillation water is also added here. In other words, one part of extract corresponds to one part of vanilla. This preparation is a dark brown viscous liquid, and it is truly a \u201cTen-fold Vanilla Extract\u201d in commercial (American) terms. The extract will inevitably separate small amounts of oily liquid after standing or cool storage. This oil can be separated without significant loss of extract or flavor. The clarified extract is primarily a flavor material since it is not miscible with essential oils or most synthetic perfume materials. The miscibility could be improved by the use of triethylene glycol, heptylene glycol, hexylene glycol or triacetin in place of propylene glycol. However, such preparations would be banned from use in flavors in most countries.",

        "background_info": "This is a prepared perfume and flavor material. In most countries, the alcohol control is extended to such uses of alcohol as in the preparation of tinctures. Consequently, the vanilla tinctures for perfumery use are made with \u201cperfume alcohol\u201d, i.e. ethyl alcohol denatured with diethyl phthalate, brucine sulfate or the like. The aromatic principles in the vanilla fruit are more soluble in diluted alcohol than in concentrated (pure) ethyl alcohol. Accordingly, the vanilla tinctures for flavors and for perfumes are two different products, in solvents and in composition. Perfume Tincture: The classic vanilla tincture was prepared from 125 grams vanilla fruits and 1000 grams of 95 % ethyl alcohol. The chopped or coarsely ground vanilla was macerated with the alcohol for 14 days, then filtered. The resulting tincture contained considerably less than 95 % alcohol since it had absorbed the water from the vanilla fruits (see Vanilla). With little or no standard for moisture content in vanilla fruits, such tinctures were far from uniform. For ordinary use in perfumery, a convenient tincture is that of 10% vanilla in alcohol of 95% strength. If the vanilla is of average moisture content, the resulting tincture will not fall below 90% alcohol strength which is sufficient to dissolve all the common perfume materials, too. Certain perfume houses still use the old-fashioned \u201cinfusion\u201d method of extraction: the vanilla is extracted with alcohol under reflux, i.e. while the alcohol is boiling. The rate of fruit to alcohol is either 12 \u00bd to 100 or 25 to 100. The resulting infusion may be filtered either immediately or after cooling. In both cases, it will become cloudy and show additional precipitate on standing. The alcohol strength in the infusion 25/100 may be too low for certain perfume materials (vetiver oil, cedarwood oil, sandalwood oil, etc.) because of the 8 to 15% of moisture introduced with the fruits.",

        "background_info": "Although the essential oil of vetiver rootlets apparently is a product of comparatively recent times, the rootlets themselves have been used for their fragrance since antiquity. The parent plant is a grass, Vetiveria Zizanoides, a tall perennial which originates in India, probably also in Indonesia and Ceylon. Vetiver Oil is steam distilled from cleaned and washed rootlets which are dried, cut and chopped, then again usually soaked in water prior to distillation. Vetiver Oil is an amber colored to grayish brown, olive brown or dark brown viscous liquid whose odor is sweet and very heavy woody-earthy, reminiscent of roots and wet soil, with a rich undertone of \u201cprecious wood\u201d notes. Oils distilled from too young rootlets and very freshly distilled oils may display some \u201cgreen\u201d potato-peel-like or asparagus-like topnotes. These are not appreciated by the perfumer, but the peculiar topnote is exploited in flavor work. There is no definite rule to confirm the saying that dark oils are superior perfume oils, nor that the optical rotation will indicate the quality of the oil. The consumer who wishes to use his vetiver oil for isolation of vetiverol (a mixture of sesquiterpene alcohols in the oil) will soon find out during a test distillation how much vetiverol is in the oil. Vetiverol is responsible for the very faint, but tenacious, suave and sweet-woody odor, while the Vetiverone (corresponding ketone mixture) seems to lend bitter earthiness\u2014and also tenacity\u2014to the odor of the oil. Esters of vetiverol are still higher boiling and may have very little odor value, but they are excellent fixatives. Only the lower boiling \u201chead fractions\u201d are definitely undesirable from a perfumery point of view. Vetiver Oil is used extensively in perfumery not only as a fixative, but also as an odor contributor in bases such as foug\u00e8re, chypre, modern woody-aldehydic or ambre-aldehydic bases, Oriental bases, moss and wood notes, opopanax bases, rose bases, etc. ",

These notes are found in the higher boiling fractions of wormwood oil, thujone being a comparatively low-boiling component.

        "background_info": "Ylang-Ylang Oil has been called \u201cthe poor man\u2019s jasmin\u201d, a nickname which the author strongly resents. He would rather call it \u201ceverybody\u2019s ylang-ylang\u201d. A good ylang-ylang oil need not be compared to any other perfume oil. It is so unusual in itself, so simple and yet so complex of odor, so generally popular a fragrance, that it easily finds its own place in perfumery, not merely as a replacement for jasmin, but as an improvement to almost any type of floral fragrance. However, one might say that the essential oil is poorer than the absolute of ylang-ylang from a viewpoint of floral fineness and magnificence. Adulteration or contamination of the ylang-ylang flowers with flowers of Artabotrys Suaveolens (see this monograph) occurs not infrequently in the oils from Indonesia and the Philippines. The first distillate of ylang-ylang oil, usually the first 30 to 45 % of the total distillate, is called Ylang-Ylang Extra. There is no standard as to the physico-chemical properties of \u201cExtra\u201d or any of the other grades, but it is left to the distiller\u2019s discretion to make the correct fractionation during the distillation. After the \u201cextra\u201d quality comes Ylang-Ylang First (\u201cpremiere\u201d), then the Second (\u201cseconde\u201d) and finally Ylang-Ylang Third (\u201ctroisi\u00e8me\u201d). Ylang-Ylang Extra is a pale yellow oil with a very powerful, floral and intensely sweet odor and a cresylic and benzoate-like topnote of limited tenacity. The fadeout is more pleasant, soft and sweet, slightly spicy and balsamic-floral. A high- grade \u201cextra\u201d oil resembles the absolute of ylang-ylang in odor type very closely. The former is, however, often more sharp-cresylic in its topnote. A peculiar creamy-sweet note is characteristic of good \u201cextra\u201d oils; this note appears very early in the evaporation, although it seems to be present also in the higher boiling fractions (in good \u201cthird\u201d oils), and it definitely is missing in the first fractions when \u201cextra\u201d is vacuum-redistilled. This suave, soft and persistent note is very difficult to reproduce in artificial ylang-ylang oils. Ylang-Ylang Extra is used mainly in high-class perfumes of the floral and heavy-Oriental type, but mere traces of the oil can do wonders in medium-priced floral bases. There is hardly any floral type, where ylang-ylang \u201cextra\u201d would not fit in. Ylang-Ylang Oil \u201cThird\u201d is a yellowish oily liquid of sweet-floral and balsamic-woody odor, with a tenacious and very sweet-balsamic undertone. This oil was once used in place of Cananga Oil, but such a replacement is unjust to both oils. They are not interchangeable, either in floral type nor in fixative effect. With its tenacity and fair stability, the ylang-ylang No. 3 is useful in soap perfumery and as a comparatively low-cost floral material for hyacinths, lilacs, etc. if cost is a major problem. ",
