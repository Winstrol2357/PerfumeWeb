After proper maceration of the wood, this oleo. resin will yield an essential oil upon distillation. Wood from infected trees is cut and coarsely chopped, then soaked in water prior to distillation. It is common practice to add salt (sodium chloride) to the water. Being a distillation at atmospheric pressure (100\u00b0C.), the process of total exhaustion of the wood is a lengthy one. The oil is high-boiling, and the distillation waters must be cohobated (i.e. returned to the still and redistilled) in order to produce a reasonable yield and a complete oil. Agar Oil is pale yellow to brownish yellow or dark amber in color; it is a very viscous liquid of rich and sweet-woody, almost balsamic odor not unlike that of vetiverol or purified styrenefree styrax, and with a sweetness similar to that of sandalwood oil.

As little as 0.02 grams of this poison is lethal to the average human being. This amount of hydrocyanic acid can be present in about 8 to 10 drops of crude, unrectified Bitter Almond Oil. It is interesting to note that hydrocyanic acid has an odor which is somewhat similar to that of Benzaldehyde, the main constituent of bitter almond oil. Bitter Almond Oil is a colorless liquid of strong, but sweet and clean odor, reminiscent of crushed, wet bitter almonds or of a very high grade of benzaldehyde. The odor is also familiar to those who prepare or enjoy the European candy known as \u201cMarcipan\u201d. Bitter Almond Oil, which is almost pure Benzaldehyde, is not a very stable oil. An addition of 10% (but not less) of ethyl alcohol is recommended as a stabilizer, and the oil should be stored in well filled glass containers, protected from daylight, moisture and air.

        "background": "Ambra, also called Ambregris or Ambergris, is a substance of animal tissue, formed in the stomach or intestine of Physeter Catodon, the cachalot whale. It is conceivable that Ambra is the result of a pathological condition caused by irritation of the whale\u2019s stomach walls due to certain indigestible particles in the whale\u2019s food. Consequently, Ambra is one of the few natural perfumery raw materials which cannot be \u201ccultivated\u201d. Pieces of Ambra are either washed ashore on various temperate ocean coasts and islands, or they are found inside the whales when these great mammals are captured for their oil. Ambra is a pale grayish or creamy-yellow to brown or dark brown waxy solid mass which melts in boiling water. Its odor is rather subtle, reminiscent of seaweed, wood, moss, with a peculiar sweet, yet very dry undertone of unequaled tenacity. There is rarely any animal note at all in a good grade of Ambra. The greater part of a good grade of Ambra is soluble in alcohol. By concentration of the tincture, the so-called Resinoid of Ambergris is obtained. When concentrated 20 times, the ambergris tincture turns into a light brown, semi-solid mass, which could be called \u201c20-fold tincture of ambergris\u201d. Ambra has comparatively little diffusive power, but it has a tremendous tenacity. Musk or Civet are required to improve the \u201cwearability\u201d of a perfume. Consequently, Ambra Tincture is particularly recommended in the more delicate florals, e.g. muguet, sweet pea, lilac, freesia, cyclamen, white rose, etc. In the modern aldehydic \u201cfantasy\u201d perfume bases, the use of Ambra or a similar \u201cbouquetting\u201d agent is a necessity in order to \u201cround off\u201d the stubborn chemical notes of aliphatic aldehydes.

Other grades of Sumatra Benzoin are solid masses, dark blocks of gray or brown-gray, uneven lumps containing more or less quantities of dirt, sand, wood splinters, etc. Benzoin Sumatra is a low-cost and readily available raw material, extensively used as a replacement for Siam Benzoin which is far more expensive.

Only the expressed oil from the peels of the fruits from the small bergamot tree, Citrus Bergamia, are of any substantial interest. The leaves and twigs may be distilled to yield a Bergamot-Petitgrain Oil, the fruits are not edible. Bergamot Oil is produced by cold expression from the peel of the nearly ripe fruit. The tree grows almost exclusively in a narrow coastal strip in the southern part of Calabria, Italy. Bergamot Oil is a green or olive green, mobile liquid of extremely rich, sweet-fruity initial odor. Although the characteristics of this topnote remain perceptible in good oils, it is followed by a still more characteristic oily-herbaceous and somewhat balsamic body and dryout. The sweetness yields to a more tobacco like and rich note, somewhat reminiscent of sage clary and nerylacetate. The freshness in the topnote is mainly due to terpenes and small amounts of citral and aliphatic aldehydes. Absence of the \u201coily\u201d note is one of the most revealing features in poor or adulterated bergamot oils. The color of bergamot oil fades on ageing, particularly when the oil is exposed to daylight. The oil turns yellow or pale olive-brown. The color is also dependent upon the maturity of the fruit at the moment of expressing. Like all other citrus oils, Bergamot Oil is produced in the immediate vicinity of the plantations. The oil is used extensively in perfumery for its sweet freshness, particularly in citrus colognes, chypres, foug\u00e8res, modern fantasy bases, etc. Part of the sweetness and rich bodynote is due to the presence of large amounts of linalylacetate combined with linalool and traces of methylanthranilate. Unlike most other citrus oils, Bergamot Oil has a certain fixative effect when used in fairly high concentrations. The odor of the oil is well balanced from nature through the presence of certain coumarin derivatives, some of which are odorless and non-volatile. ",

Certain users of high-grade terpeneless bergamot oil will perform their own deterpenation, e.g. by selective solvent extraction or by the chromatographic methods. These methods result in practically colorless oils with a negligible loss of low- boiling and important oxygenated components. Occasionally, only the coarse-smelling light monoterpenes and the waxy residues are removed by simple vacuum-distillation. This yields an oil which is well suited for perfumery purposes: it will have improved solubility and intensified, rich body notes. The freshness is greatly impaired by this deterpenation.

The dryout bears some resemblance to the dryout notes of Atlas cedarwood oil. The essential oil consists almost entirely of monoterpenes and has little perfumery value. Canada balsam is used to a limited extent as a fixative in finer pine needle fragrances to which it also lends a certain freshness.

The seeds are enclosed in husks (hulls), and should not be removed from the almost odorless hulls until immediately prior to distillation. Cardamom Oil is an almost colorless or pale yellow to light brownish liquid. It darkens when exposed to daylight. The locally distilled oils are generally darker than those distilled in Europe or the U.S.A. Guatemalan oil is distilled in comparatively modern equipment and under experienced technical supervision. It is also light colored. The odor of cardamom oil is warm-spicy, aromatic, at first penetrating camphoraceous-cineole-like or somewhat medicinal, reminiscent of eucalyptus. Later, it becomes balsamic-woody, increasingly sweet and almost floral on the dryout. The odor is extremely tenacious with a delightful, warm spiciness and balsamic-floral undertone. In perfumery, the oil will not only impart spiciness, but also a warm, sweet note which fits into floral bases such as muguet and rose. Coriander oil is an extremely fine modifier for cardamom oil in perfumery. The oil imparts warmth in Oriental perfume bases, chypres and face powder perfumes. ",

Cinnamon Bark Oil \u201cCeylon\u201d is a pale yellow to dark yellow or brownish-yellow, somewhat oily liquid of extremely powerful, diffusive, warm- spicy, sweet and tenacious odor. The undertone and dryout notes reveal a persistent dryness which is very unique in combination with the distinct sweetness. Characteristic is a dry powdery-dusty, but warm, uniform and lasting dry-out note. In the very first topnotes, one may find a certain fruity freshness, similar to the sweet candy-like freshness in a good clove bud oil. The main constituents of Ceylon cinnamon bark oil are cinnamic aldehyde, eugenol, aceteugenol, and trace amounts of various aldehydes. Together with methyl-n-amyl ketone, the latter are probably responsible for the power and the characteristic notes in good oils. In perfumery, the oil blends well with Oriental- woody notes, and the combination with olibanum is known and often utilized. The warmth and dry spiciness, the immediate sweetness and tremendous diffusive power (or \u201cradiation\u201d) induced by the addition of fractions of one percent of this oil in a perfume composition, is highly appreciated by certain perfumers.

The crude civet arrives in Europe and the U.S.A. in Zebu horns, containing about 500 to 1200 grams of the buttery yellowish paste which turns darker and more solid on age. The contents of one average Zebu horn represents the production from one civet cat in Four Years. During this period, the animal will consume something like the raw meat from 50 (fifty) sheep, and the poor cat, frequently teased in its narrow cage, will have undergone 400 to 800 painful \u201cscrapings\u201d of its glands. The raw meat, the narrow cage and the teasing are all means of increasing the production of the civet secretion which is scraped off with regular intervals while the cat is caged. It is no wonder that Civet is one of the most expensive perfume raw materials! But, thanks to the outstanding power of civet, its price does not prohibit its use by any means. From the crude natural civet, a Concr\u00e8te of Civet is produced by hydrocarbon extraction. The yield of Concr\u00e8te is about 50 to 60% of the crude secretion, and the larger part of the concr\u00e8te is alcohol-soluble Civet Absolute. Civet Absolute dilutions, or Civet Tincture, are very commonly used perfume materials. They not only present excellent fixative value, but, most important, they lend a distinct natural-animal note when used with care and with an experienced touch. Overdoses produce obnoxious notes, and it should be kept in mind that civet products tends to \u201cgrow\u201d in a perfume. Civet products are used in a \u2018great variety of perfume types, particularly in the better lotion perfumes of the rose-type, Oriental types, \u201choney\u201d- notes, narcissus bases, ambre types, etc. The use of civet extracts or tinctures in muguet and other delicate floral bases may seem surprising to the layman, but this application of civet is well known and highly appreciated. The \u201clift\u201d and radiation (diffusive power) derived from minute quantities of civet tincture in certain types of perfumes is quite unique and this effect can only be adequately understood through long experience with good grades of civet. The odor of Civet extracts (tinctures, absolutes, etc.) and of crude civet, too, should be typically animal-sweet, free from faecal notes, urine notes or the like.

When coconut meat is expressed hydraulically the oil will contain the volatile substances. The crude coconut oil is subsequently steam distilled in order to recover these odorous components. An essential oil of coconut is produced this way. However, the so-called Coconut Absolute is prod- used by alcohol extraction of the crude coconut oil. The alcohol is distilled off under gentle vacuum. A somewhat different coconut absolute is obtained by alcohol extraction of the press-cake of \u201cdeoleated\u201d coconut meat. This type of coconut absolute has a \u201cheavier\u201d, more nutty type of odor and a darker color.

Coconut Absolute is an interesting material in the hands of the experienced and artistic perfumer for his work in unconventional perfumery.

        "background_info": "Cognac Oil, also known as Wine Lees Oil or Weinhefeoel (in German), is a by product from the distillation of Cognac (Brandy). An oil can be obtained by steam distillation of the residue of grape tissue and fungus precipitate after fermentation (and distillation) of the alcoholic beverage. Water distillation is also applied directly to a slurry of the yeast residue in water. The aromatic principles in Cognac Oil are generally higher boiling esters of ethyl and iso-amyl alcohols, and they do not distil readily with the hydro-alcoholic mixture which is known as Cognac after proper maturing and ageing. The crude cognac oil may be redistilled to yield a very powerful aromatic which represents the maximum concentration of high-boiling esters from the cognac yeast precipitate. Cognac Oil is a pale yellow or greenish yellow, somewhat oily liquid of intensely strong, almost harsh-fruity, oily-fatty, yet green-herbaceous odor of outstanding tenacity and great diffusive power. The rectified oil is used in flavors and perfumes in trace amounts to give \u201clift\u201d and fresh-fruity, natural notes, e.g. in liqueurs, fruit flavors, colognes, foug\u00e8res, after-shave fragrances, etc.",

        "background_info": "Among the numerous varieties of edible citrus fruits, many are known only in small or isolated areas where they have become not only a local variety, but also a local delicacy. A certain citrus tree in the Comoro islands northwest of Madagascar and in other nearby islands and in Madagascar itself produces large and very delicate fruits, locally known as combavas. But when a local essential oil distillery undertook steam distillation of the leaves and twigs of this citrus variety, a new petitgrain oil was discovered: Combava Petitgrain Oil. The oil is distinguished by its very delicate sweetness and freshness which is distinctly different from bitter orange petitgrain or other well-known petitgrain oils. Still more interesting is it, that this oil contains laevo-Citronellal as one of its main constituents. It was hoped that the oil could thus become a new starting material for the production of laevo-Citronellol (by reduction), a perfume material sometimes called rhodinol. Combava Petitgrain Oil is a pale yellow to greenish yellow, mobile liquid of fresh-leafy, sweet-rosy odor, somewhat reminiscent of the odor of Guinea lemon petitgrain oil and eucalyptus citriodora oil. In perfumes the oil would probably be needed in larger concentration since it appears well fit for the soap and detergent type of fragrances. It could also find use as a modifier in citrus colognes and, generally, as a new topnote ingredient. ",

        "background_info": "Copaiba Balsam, also known as Copahu Balsam is one of the most \u201cnatural\u201d (unprocessed) of all the natural perfume materials. It is used in perfumes exactly as it comes out of the tree, exactly as it occurs in nature. Copaiba Balsam is a natural oleoresin which occurs as a physiological product in various Copaifera species. Copaiba \u201cBalsam\u201d is a more or less viscous, brownish-yellow or grayish-greenish yellow liquid which dries to a hard and brittle resin upon exposure to air. The oleoresin is not always clear or translucent, but may be hazy due to its water content or to the continuous resinification of the essential oil part of the oleoresin, a process which starts already inside the trunk. The odor of the oleoresin is very faint, mild-woody, slightly spicy- peppery and modestly tenacious. The flavor is bitter and irritant. Since copaiba \u201cbalsam\u201d is mainly used for its fixative properties, it is reasonable that the \u201cbalsams\u201d with a low content of essential oil are preferred for this purpose. It is often used as a fixative in low-cost violet and wood perfumes, for lavender or foug\u00e8res in detergent perfumes, industrial perfumes, etc.",

        "background_info": "An essential oil is obtained by direct distillation (dry, in vacuum) of Copaiba \u201cBalsam\u201d.  It is customary to select the copaibas which contain a very high percentage of volatile oil for this purpose. Such balsams are less appreciated as commercial copaiba balsam since they dry out more slowly and yield less resin. For the same reason, they are poorer fixatives in perfumery, and thus the low-oil copaibas find their way into perfumery and porcelain-painting, etc., while the high-oil copaibas are distilled. Copaiba \u201cBalsam\u201d Oil (or Copaiba Oil) is a colorless or pale yellow to yellow-green or bluish, very mobile oil. The odor is similar to that of the \u201cbalsam\u201d, but much milder, sweeter, almost creamy-balsamic with a faint peppery-spicy undertone. There are notes which resemble furfuryl alcohol and cadinene, others may remind of the notes in Peru balsam oil. A very peculiar and complex, but very faint odor. Copaiba Oil finds some use in perfumery, but its fixative value is negligible and its contribution to the overall odor of a fragrance is questionable. Its main use is that of a blender-modifier. The oil is used in pine fragrances, woody bases, violet perfumes, spice fragrances, etc., and its low cost and good availability makes it popular for some of these purposes. However, it is still missing from many a perfumer\u2019s shelf, and it is unlikely that the oil will ever arouse any particular interest.",

        "background_info": "Costus Oil is steam distilled from the comminuted, dried roots of Saussurea Lappa, a large impressive plant which is found growing wild in the Himalayan highlands at high altitude. Prior to distillation, the roots are not only comminuted, but also macerated in water. The distillation is then a combination of water- and steam-distillation. This is similar to some vetiver distillations. The oil does not separate well from the condensed water, partly because of the fact that its specific gravity is almost the same as that of water, partly because of water-solubility of certain components of the oil. Costus Oil is a pale yellow to brownish yellow, very viscous liquid. It has a peculiar soft, but extremely tenacious odor, reminiscent of old, precious wood, orris root, fatty (but not rancid) acids, vetiverol, etc., with a distinctly animal or sebaceous undertone. The odor has been compared to that of human hair, fur coats or \u201cwet dogs\u201d. The latter description is often heard from people who smell costus oil for the first time. It is certain that not all people will like this odor. In surprisingly small concentrations, Costus Oil will induce warm, woody and \u201cnatural\u201d notes to a perfume; however, this is limited to certain perfume types, e.g. Oriental bases, chypres, violet bases, certain floral fragrances, etc., and many types of the \u201cmodern-aldehydic\u201d theme. Overdoses of costus oil may easily produce obnoxious effects, and the power of this oil is often under-estimated. Similar in effect to angelica root oil, Costus Oil has the peculiar ability of producing diffusive power and intriguing topnotes, and at the same time it works effectively as a fixative of unusual tenacity.
