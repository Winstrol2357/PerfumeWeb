After proper maceration of the wood, this oleo. resin will yield an essential oil upon distillation. Wood from infected trees is cut and coarsely chopped, then soaked in water prior to distillation. It is common practice to add salt (sodium chloride) to the water. Being a distillation at atmospheric pressure (100\u00b0C.), the process of total exhaustion of the wood is a lengthy one. The oil is high-boiling, and the distillation waters must be cohobated (i.e. returned to the still and redistilled) in order to produce a reasonable yield and a complete oil. Agar Oil is pale yellow to brownish yellow or dark amber in color; it is a very viscous liquid of rich and sweet-woody, almost balsamic odor not unlike that of vetiverol or purified styrenefree styrax, and with a sweetness similar to that of sandalwood oil.

As little as 0.02 grams of this poison is lethal to the average human being. This amount of hydrocyanic acid can be present in about 8 to 10 drops of crude, unrectified Bitter Almond Oil. It is interesting to note that hydrocyanic acid has an odor which is somewhat similar to that of Benzaldehyde, the main constituent of bitter almond oil. Bitter Almond Oil is a colorless liquid of strong, but sweet and clean odor, reminiscent of crushed, wet bitter almonds or of a very high grade of benzaldehyde. The odor is also familiar to those who prepare or enjoy the European candy known as \u201cMarcipan\u201d. Bitter Almond Oil, which is almost pure Benzaldehyde, is not a very stable oil. An addition of 10% (but not less) of ethyl alcohol is recommended as a stabilizer, and the oil should be stored in well filled glass containers, protected from daylight, moisture and air.

        "background": "Ambra, also called Ambregris or Ambergris, is a substance of animal tissue, formed in the stomach or intestine of Physeter Catodon, the cachalot whale. It is conceivable that Ambra is the result of a pathological condition caused by irritation of the whale\u2019s stomach walls due to certain indigestible particles in the whale\u2019s food. Consequently, Ambra is one of the few natural perfumery raw materials which cannot be \u201ccultivated\u201d. Pieces of Ambra are either washed ashore on various temperate ocean coasts and islands, or they are found inside the whales when these great mammals are captured for their oil. Ambra is a pale grayish or creamy-yellow to brown or dark brown waxy solid mass which melts in boiling water. Its odor is rather subtle, reminiscent of seaweed, wood, moss, with a peculiar sweet, yet very dry undertone of unequaled tenacity. There is rarely any animal note at all in a good grade of Ambra. The greater part of a good grade of Ambra is soluble in alcohol. By concentration of the tincture, the so-called Resinoid of Ambergris is obtained. When concentrated 20 times, the ambergris tincture turns into a light brown, semi-solid mass, which could be called \u201c20-fold tincture of ambergris\u201d. Ambra has comparatively little diffusive power, but it has a tremendous tenacity. Musk or Civet are required to improve the \u201cwearability\u201d of a perfume. Consequently, Ambra Tincture is particularly recommended in the more delicate florals, e.g. muguet, sweet pea, lilac, freesia, cyclamen, white rose, etc. In the modern aldehydic \u201cfantasy\u201d perfume bases, the use of Ambra or a similar \u201cbouquetting\u201d agent is a necessity in order to \u201cround off\u201d the stubborn chemical notes of aliphatic aldehydes.

Other grades of Sumatra Benzoin are solid masses, dark blocks of gray or brown-gray, uneven lumps containing more or less quantities of dirt, sand, wood splinters, etc. Benzoin Sumatra is a low-cost and readily available raw material, extensively used as a replacement for Siam Benzoin which is far more expensive.

Only the expressed oil from the peels of the fruits from the small bergamot tree, Citrus Bergamia, are of any substantial interest. The leaves and twigs may be distilled to yield a Bergamot-Petitgrain Oil, the fruits are not edible. Bergamot Oil is produced by cold expression from the peel of the nearly ripe fruit. The tree grows almost exclusively in a narrow coastal strip in the southern part of Calabria, Italy. Bergamot Oil is a green or olive green, mobile liquid of extremely rich, sweet-fruity initial odor. Although the characteristics of this topnote remain perceptible in good oils, it is followed by a still more characteristic oily-herbaceous and somewhat balsamic body and dryout. The sweetness yields to a more tobacco like and rich note, somewhat reminiscent of sage clary and nerylacetate. The freshness in the topnote is mainly due to terpenes and small amounts of citral and aliphatic aldehydes. Absence of the \u201coily\u201d note is one of the most revealing features in poor or adulterated bergamot oils. The color of bergamot oil fades on ageing, particularly when the oil is exposed to daylight. The oil turns yellow or pale olive-brown. The color is also dependent upon the maturity of the fruit at the moment of expressing. Like all other citrus oils, Bergamot Oil is produced in the immediate vicinity of the plantations. The oil is used extensively in perfumery for its sweet freshness, particularly in citrus colognes, chypres, foug\u00e8res, modern fantasy bases, etc. Part of the sweetness and rich bodynote is due to the presence of large amounts of linalylacetate combined with linalool and traces of methylanthranilate. Unlike most other citrus oils, Bergamot Oil has a certain fixative effect when used in fairly high concentrations. The odor of the oil is well balanced from nature through the presence of certain coumarin derivatives, some of which are odorless and non-volatile. ",

Certain users of high-grade terpeneless bergamot oil will perform their own deterpenation, e.g. by selective solvent extraction or by the chromatographic methods. These methods result in practically colorless oils with a negligible loss of low- boiling and important oxygenated components. Occasionally, only the coarse-smelling light monoterpenes and the waxy residues are removed by simple vacuum-distillation. This yields an oil which is well suited for perfumery purposes: it will have improved solubility and intensified, rich body notes. The freshness is greatly impaired by this deterpenation.

The dryout bears some resemblance to the dryout notes of Atlas cedarwood oil. The essential oil consists almost entirely of monoterpenes and has little perfumery value. Canada balsam is used to a limited extent as a fixative in finer pine needle fragrances to which it also lends a certain freshness.

The seeds are enclosed in husks (hulls), and should not be removed from the almost odorless hulls until immediately prior to distillation. Cardamom Oil is an almost colorless or pale yellow to light brownish liquid. It darkens when exposed to daylight. The locally distilled oils are generally darker than those distilled in Europe or the U.S.A. Guatemalan oil is distilled in comparatively modern equipment and under experienced technical supervision. It is also light colored. The odor of cardamom oil is warm-spicy, aromatic, at first penetrating camphoraceous-cineole-like or somewhat medicinal, reminiscent of eucalyptus. Later, it becomes balsamic-woody, increasingly sweet and almost floral on the dryout. The odor is extremely tenacious with a delightful, warm spiciness and balsamic-floral undertone. In perfumery, the oil will not only impart spiciness, but also a warm, sweet note which fits into floral bases such as muguet and rose. Coriander oil is an extremely fine modifier for cardamom oil in perfumery. The oil imparts warmth in Oriental perfume bases, chypres and face powder perfumes. ",

Cinnamon Bark Oil \u201cCeylon\u201d is a pale yellow to dark yellow or brownish-yellow, somewhat oily liquid of extremely powerful, diffusive, warm- spicy, sweet and tenacious odor. The undertone and dryout notes reveal a persistent dryness which is very unique in combination with the distinct sweetness. Characteristic is a dry powdery-dusty, but warm, uniform and lasting dry-out note. In the very first topnotes, one may find a certain fruity freshness, similar to the sweet candy-like freshness in a good clove bud oil. The main constituents of Ceylon cinnamon bark oil are cinnamic aldehyde, eugenol, aceteugenol, and trace amounts of various aldehydes. Together with methyl-n-amyl ketone, the latter are probably responsible for the power and the characteristic notes in good oils. In perfumery, the oil blends well with Oriental- woody notes, and the combination with olibanum is known and often utilized. The warmth and dry spiciness, the immediate sweetness and tremendous diffusive power (or \u201cradiation\u201d) induced by the addition of fractions of one percent of this oil in a perfume composition, is highly appreciated by certain perfumers.

The crude civet arrives in Europe and the U.S.A. in Zebu horns, containing about 500 to 1200 grams of the buttery yellowish paste which turns darker and more solid on age. The contents of one average Zebu horn represents the production from one civet cat in Four Years. During this period, the animal will consume something like the raw meat from 50 (fifty) sheep, and the poor cat, frequently teased in its narrow cage, will have undergone 400 to 800 painful \u201cscrapings\u201d of its glands. The raw meat, the narrow cage and the teasing are all means of increasing the production of the civet secretion which is scraped off with regular intervals while the cat is caged. It is no wonder that Civet is one of the most expensive perfume raw materials! But, thanks to the outstanding power of civet, its price does not prohibit its use by any means. From the crude natural civet, a Concr\u00e8te of Civet is produced by hydrocarbon extraction. The yield of Concr\u00e8te is about 50 to 60% of the crude secretion, and the larger part of the concr\u00e8te is alcohol-soluble Civet Absolute. Civet Absolute dilutions, or Civet Tincture, are very commonly used perfume materials. They not only present excellent fixative value, but, most important, they lend a distinct natural-animal note when used with care and with an experienced touch. Overdoses produce obnoxious notes, and it should be kept in mind that civet products tends to \u201cgrow\u201d in a perfume. Civet products are used in a \u2018great variety of perfume types, particularly in the better lotion perfumes of the rose-type, Oriental types, \u201choney\u201d- notes, narcissus bases, ambre types, etc. The use of civet extracts or tinctures in muguet and other delicate floral bases may seem surprising to the layman, but this application of civet is well known and highly appreciated. The \u201clift\u201d and radiation (diffusive power) derived from minute quantities of civet tincture in certain types of perfumes is quite unique and this effect can only be adequately understood through long experience with good grades of civet. The odor of Civet extracts (tinctures, absolutes, etc.) and of crude civet, too, should be typically animal-sweet, free from faecal notes, urine notes or the like.

When coconut meat is expressed hydraulically the oil will contain the volatile substances. The crude coconut oil is subsequently steam distilled in order to recover these odorous components. An essential oil of coconut is produced this way. However, the so-called Coconut Absolute is prod- used by alcohol extraction of the crude coconut oil. The alcohol is distilled off under gentle vacuum. A somewhat different coconut absolute is obtained by alcohol extraction of the press-cake of \u201cdeoleated\u201d coconut meat. This type of coconut absolute has a \u201cheavier\u201d, more nutty type of odor and a darker color.

It has a peculiar fruity-fatty, very fresh and light, yet tenacious odor. Only upon extreme dilution (about 1.0 mg% or lower) the nutty and typical fragrance appears. Coconut Absolute is an interesting material in the hands of the experienced and artistic perfumer for his work in unconventional perfumery.

        "background_info": "Cognac Oil, also known as Wine Lees Oil or Weinhefeoel (in German), is a by product from the distillation of Cognac (Brandy). An oil can be obtained by steam distillation of the residue of grape tissue and fungus precipitate after fermentation (and distillation) of the alcoholic beverage. Water distillation is also applied directly to a slurry of the yeast residue in water. The aromatic principles in Cognac Oil are generally higher boiling esters of ethyl and iso-amyl alcohols, and they do not distil readily with the hydro-alcoholic mixture which is known as Cognac after proper maturing and ageing. The crude cognac oil may be redistilled to yield a very powerful aromatic which represents the maximum concentration of high-boiling esters from the cognac yeast precipitate. Cognac Oil is a pale yellow or greenish yellow, somewhat oily liquid of intensely strong, almost harsh-fruity, oily-fatty, yet green-herbaceous odor of outstanding tenacity and great diffusive power. The rectified oil is used in flavors and perfumes in trace amounts to give \u201clift\u201d and fresh-fruity, natural notes, e.g. in liqueurs, fruit flavors, colognes, foug\u00e8res, after-shave fragrances, etc.",

A certain citrus tree in the Comoro islands northwest of Madagascar and in other nearby islands and in Madagascar itself produces large and very delicate fruits, locally known as combavas. But when a local essential oil distillery undertook steam distillation of the leaves and twigs of this citrus variety, a new petitgrain oil was discovered: Combava Petitgrain Oil. The oil is distinguished by its very delicate sweetness and freshness which is distinctly different from bitter orange petitgrain or other well-known petitgrain oils. Still more interesting is it, that this oil contains laevo-Citronellal as one of its main constituents. It was hoped that the oil could thus become a new starting material for the production of laevo-Citronellol (by reduction), a perfume material sometimes called rhodinol. Combava Petitgrain Oil is a pale yellow to greenish yellow, mobile liquid of fresh-leafy, sweet-rosy odor, somewhat reminiscent of the odor of Guinea lemon petitgrain oil and eucalyptus citriodora oil. In perfumes the oil would probably be needed in larger concentration since it appears well fit for the soap and detergent type of fragrances. It could also find use as a modifier in citrus colognes and, generally, as a new topnote ingredient. ",

It is customary to select the copaibas which contain a very high percentage of volatile oil for this purpose. Such balsams are less appreciated as commercial copaiba balsam since they dry out more slowly and yield less resin. For the same reason, they are poorer fixatives in perfumery, and thus the low-oil copaibas find their way into perfumery and porcelain-painting, etc., while the high-oil copaibas are distilled. Copaiba \u201cBalsam\u201d Oil (or Copaiba Oil) is a colorless or pale yellow to yellow-green or bluish, very mobile oil. The odor is similar to that of the \u201cbalsam\u201d, but much milder, sweeter, almost creamy-balsamic with a faint peppery-spicy undertone. There are notes which resemble furfuryl alcohol and cadinene, others may remind of the notes in Peru balsam oil. A very peculiar and complex, but very faint odor. Copaiba Oil finds some use in perfumery, but its fixative value is negligible and its contribution to the overall odor of a fragrance is questionable. Its main use is that of a blender-modifier. The oil is used in pine fragrances, woody bases, violet perfumes, spice fragrances, etc., and its low cost and good availability makes it popular for some of these purposes. However, it is still missing from many a perfumer\u2019s shelf, and it is unlikely that the oil will ever arouse any particular interest.",

It is customary to collect and distil the material which is obtained by the annual pruning of the trees, perhaps together with twigs, etc. torn off the trees during the winter mistral, the violent storm. This is why Cypress Oil is usually available only in very limited quantities and only at certain times of the year. Cypress Oil is a pale yellow, pale olive-greenish or almost colorless, mobile liquid of sweetbalsamic, yet refreshing odor, reminiscent of pine needles oil, templin oil, juniper berry oil, cardamom oil (without the cineole-note), and with a unique dryout of delicate and tenacious sweetness, often compared to that of ambre (labdanum ambre). This \u201cpartially deterpenized\u201d cypress oil is used in perfumes of the ambre-labdanum type in combinations with cistus oil or other labdanum products, delta-methylionone (so-called), lavender oil, mandarin oil, sage clary, musk ambrette or macrocyclic musks, styrax products, moroccan chamomile oil, etc. Cypress Oil (natural oil) is occasionally used as a modifier in pine needle fragrances, in citrus colognes, foug\u00e8res, chypres, and in the modern aldehydic type of perfumes.

The roots were extracted or infused to prepare a medicine of diuretic effect, etc. The leaves of this plant become very fragrant when they are dried. The leaves of Deertongue, as the composite plant is called in the U.S.A., do not yield any essential oil when they are distilled, but a highly aromatic extract, called Oleoresin of Deertongue, is prepared from the dried leaves with a volatile hydrocarbon solvent. After removal of the solvent in vacuum, the oleoresin appears as a dark green, very viscous liquid or semiliquid mass, possessing a heavy-sweet, coumarin-like, rich herbaceous odor. The immediate odor-similarity to shag tobacco is probably a reflection of the fact that the extract has been used since long ago for the flavoring of tobacco. Under the name of Deertongue, Lacinaria or Liatris Oleoresin, the extracts have been used for many decades in the food flavoring industry also, until the coumarin ban in 1952. In perfumery, however, Liatris Oleoresin or Liatris Absolute are used frequently in chypre, moss, new mown hay, Oriental, and similar sweet or coumarinic bases. Its high content of coumarin and related compounds makes it an excellent fixative, but its intense color is a drawback in certain creations and uses. With synthetic musks, it produces very interesting, dry-perfumery powder-notes, particularly in combination with heliotropine, \u201cgamma\u201d-methyl ionone, cinnamic alcohol, etc. Although it is not a very expensive perfume material, Liatris Oleoresin is used in comparatively small quantities.",

Elemi is an exudation of a pathological product from the tree, Canarium Commune, and other species of Canarium which grow wild and, to a lesser degree, cultivated in the Philippine islands. Crude Elemi is a semi-solid, pale-yellow, waxyhoneylike mass, usually containing numerous woodsplinters, bark pieces, insect debris, dirt and earth, etc. Elemi is graded on the bulking place (locally), and it is possible to get lots which are quite clean, dirt-free and almost water-free. The odor is very fresh, terpeney, peppery-lemony, with a woody-balsamic background note. The odor bears some similarity to that of dill weed oil. Elemi Resinoid is prepared by extracting the crude elemi with a volatile solvent, and removing the latter in vacuum after proper filtration. Acetone gives a very high yield and is a very good solvent for elemi. The acetone-resinoid is pale yellow, and soon shows white masses of crystals separating in the soft, slowly solidifying resinoid. Benzene gives a lower yield, and the odor of this solvent is more difficult to remove from the resinoid. Ethyl alcohol is a comparatively poor solvent for elemi, but some perfumers prefer to extract only once with one or two parts of ethyl alcohol. It will be necessary to filtrate the extract before it cools off. A smaller yield of resinoid is thus obtained, but it presents the heart of the fragrance of elemi in a more concentrated form: fewer monoterpenes, resin acids, sesquiterpenes, etc., and higher concentration of the rare but important oxygenated components of elemi. One could call this product Elemi Resin Absolute. This is a very interesting fixative for artificial bergamot, lemon, lime, etc., as well as for the various verbena compositions, e.g. eau de verveine bases and other cologne types. In lavender colognes, foug\u00e8res, spicy colognes, etc., it simultaneously introduces freshness and fixation. ",

The concr\u00e8te is a very dark green paste, often grainy, and after standing. it displays white, needleshaped crystals of an intensely sweet odor, reminiscent of the odor of strawberry jam and caramellized sugar. Fir needle concr\u00e8te is further treated with alcohol to produce an Absolute of Fir Needles which when it comes from American suppliers is a dark green, semi-liquid or syrupy mass of sweet-coumarinic, somewhat fruity and intensely balsamic odor; briefly, it is very true to nature. The absolute of fir needles from French suppliers is usually a syrupy, amber-brown, clear liquid which has an odor more balsamic and sweet than pinelike and of great tenacity. It is conceivable that the French extracts are made from dry or partly dried material which would not produce a green color in the extract. The alcohol-soluble Fir Needle Absolute is obviously stronger in odor than the concr\u00e8te (it is free from resins and waxes), and it should be used with utmost care, particularly in perfumes other than the pine types. Additions far below one percent in the perfume oil are often sufficient to introduce the wanted \u201cnaturalness\u201d to a pine fragrance, and much smaller concentrations can be used to obtain warm and \u201cspecial effects\u201d in many other perfume types.

Galbanum is one of the typical examples of a botanical which has \u201cchanged\u201d appearance, composition and odor during the past five decades. This is apparent when we look into literature from 1939, 1936, 1926 or even further back: the description of galbanum in these works is outdated. Galbanum is collected from not one, but several different species of Ferula (big umbellifer plants). These grow wild in Iran and in the countries toward Asia Minor, e.g. Lebanon. There are still\u2014as the literature correctly says\u2014two types: a hard and a soft galbanum offered commercially. For perfumery, only the soft variety has interest. The hard galbanum is used in pharmacy and for various industrial purposes. Soft Galbanum is a dark amber-colored to yellowish-brown or grayish-green, olive-brown, very viscous liquid whose consistency is like fresh honey. It is usually contaminated with wood splinters, sand, gravel, plant fibres, insects, etc., and it will separate a \u201cfoot\u201d of a grayish mass on the bottom of its container. This precipitate contains water, sand, some dissolved gum, etc., and it has no perfumery value. It is often possible to eliminate it when emptying a container, since the precipitate is not pourable, while the useful galbanum is just pourable at room temperature (over 20\u00b0 C.). The odor of crude galbanum (soft type) is powerful, green-woody, almost balsamic-resinous, reminiscent of oleoresins from conifers. The leafy- earthy, green note is often referred to in terms, such as: \u201clike green peppers\u201d or \u201ctossed green salad\u201d, etc. There is a distinct resemblance to the odor of hyacinth leaves.

Galbanum Oil is a colorless to pale yellow or pale olive-yellow, mobile liquid which possesses an intensely green, fresh-leafy odor with a dry- woody undertone of balsamic, bark like character. A very striking description often heard is \u201clike green peppers or tossed green salad\u201d. The oil has a pine-like topnote which is less pronounced in the odor of the resinoid. The latter, in turn, has a more woody-balsamic, conifer-resinous character. The pine-like topnote can be removed by fractional distillation of the oil. The woody-balsamic, soft- green and tenacious undertone can be isolated in the high-boiling fractions. Galbanol is a trade name for the latter type of galbanum oil fractions. Galbanum oil finds extensive use, although always in very modest concentrations, in compositions of chypre, foug\u00e8re, pine, forest, moss, etc., and it will introduce interesting notes in many florals where its leafy character is necessary in the completion of a true naturalness: hyacinth, violet, narcissus, lavender, gardenia, etc. It can find use in countless perfume types and bases.",

Years ago, when galbanum was a hard, grainy mass or lumps, the resinoid was prepared in the conventional way, i.e. by extraction with a hydrocarbon solvent and subsequent removal of the solvent after filtration. Because of the significant water content in the lower grades of galbanum, it was necessary to use solvents which are not miscible with water. Acetone and ethyl alcohol could not be used. Solvent-free galbanum resinoid is a semi-liquid, dark amber or brownish-golden material, almost pourable at room temperature. The odor is intensely rich-green, woody-balsamic, yet with a dry undertone, and it has the typical \u201cgreen peppers\u201d foliage-like note which is so pronounced in the essential oil. The resinoid is usually not clearly soluble in alcohol. Extracts of galbanum, prepared with ethyl alcohol as a solvent, are available. These \u201cresin absolutes\u201d are almost clearly soluble in alcohol. They are more or less \u201cterpeneless\u201d products of entirely different odor type: less green-sharp, more softbalsamic, rich, woody and very tenacious in odor. Galbanum Resinoid is an extremely interesting fixative with an odor of its own. It is useful in lavender, foug\u00e8re, Oriental bases, chypres, pine fragrances, woody bases, moss odors, and in certain floral types. Its use in hyacinth is almost classic. Galbanum resinoid has the definite advantage over many synthetic \u201cgreen-odor\u201d materials in the fact that it mellows in almost immediately: it is possible to evaluate the result and the effect during the creation of the fragrance. Synthetic materials in this odor group often \u201cgrow\u201d or \u201cfade\u201d in the perfume with a perceptible change in the odor of the perfume within a few weeks.",

Finally, this type of fragrance has been comparatively easy to copy, although a good artificial gardenia base is more rare than for example a good artificial muguet base (lily-of-the-valley). Incidentally, a close resemblance to the natural product is not synonymous with unexcelled performance in a perfume.

        "background_info": "Ginger Oil is produced by steam distillation, occasionally by water-and-steam distillation of the dried, unpeeled, freshly ground rhizomes of Zingiber Officinale, a plant which is native to the tropical coastal regions of India. The rhizomes, sun-dried and unpeeled, have been known as a spice for several thousand years, and the plant was among the early introductions to the West Indies when the Spanish seafarers roamed the Caribbean Sea shortly after A. D. 1500. Ginger Oil is a pale yellow to light amber- colored mobile liquid. Its viscosity increases upon ageing or exposure to air (resinification). The odor is warm, but fresh-woody, spicy and with a peculiar resemblance to orange, lemon, lemon- grass, coriander seed oil, etc. in the initial, fresh topnotes. The sweet and heavy undertone is tenacious, sweet and rich, almost balsamic-floral. African ginger oil is generally darker in color and presents a more fatty sweetness. The freshness is not pronounced nor is it very characteristic of that type ginger oil. It is, however, extremely rich and tenacious. Jamaican ginger oil is usually very pale in color, mobile like a pine needle oil, and with a pronounced odor-freshness of lemon- orange-coriander-like character. The body is sweet but not balsamic, the tenacity is only moderate. The initial notes of freshly distilled Ginger Oil from Jamaican rhizomes often have a peculiar \u201crubber\u201d-like type, similar to that of freshly distilled nutmeg oil (myrcene-like notes?). This note is hardly ever perceptible in African ginger oil. Ginger Oil is used in perfumery to introduce warmth and certain nuances of spicy sweetness which are often wanted in heavy Oriental bases and in a few floral fragrances, too. The interest in the oil for perfumery use has increased considerably during the recent years of the growing \u201cspice-trend\u201d in men\u2019s fragrances and in lotion perfumes in general. The Jamaican oil lends more freshness and topnote, while the Nigerian oil will give a solid body note, a warmth which is quite unique and typical of this oil. ",

        "background_info": "This oil, which is not strictly an essential oil according to our definitions, is produced by cold expression of the peel of the fruits from a Citrus species which presumably evolved from the West Indian \u201cshaddock\u201d fruit. Although not a hybrid, the grapefruit did not exist 400 years ago, and it was still a rarity around the beginning of the twentieth century. Highly developed cultivation and refining of the fruits (better juice, meat, fewer seed, etc.) has, as so often in nature, caused some changes elsewhere in the fruits: the oil from the peel has become milder and sweeter of odor than it was only a few decades ago. Grapefruit Oil is a mobile, yellowish to greenish- yellow or pale orange-yellow oil, possessing a fresh-citrusy, rather sweet odor and a similar taste. As mentioned above, the bitterness particularly known from European and Middle-Eastern fruits and peels, is no longer found in today\u2019s American grapefruit oil. The odor resembles that of sweet orange oil to a certain degree, but also has notes in common with bitter orange oil. Thus, grapefruit oil is quite useful in bergamot compositions and for all modifications of citrus notes in perfumery. Like all other citrus oils, grapefruit oil is not very stable and deteriorizes easily upon exposure to moisture, air and daylight. Antioxidants and oxygen-free storage conditions can prolong the shelf-life of these oils. Certain combinations of antioxidants are effective in concentrations of 0.002% which is far below the threshold of flavor or odor perception. ",

Guaiacwood Oil is a soft or semi-solid mass, yellowish to greenish yellow or pale amber in color. When melted, it may stay supercooled and liquid for a long time. Once again, we meet a product which quite frequently presents odor types not reported in literature: apart from its delicately sweet, rosy-woody odor which is often referred to as \u201ctearose-like\u201d, the oil may have a \u201csmoked ham\u201d odor which is definitely unwanted, but not uncommon. It is conceivable that this odor, which was never reported prior to World War II, occurs in oils which have been \u201cforced\u201d during the distillation through the addition of mineral acid (sulfuric, etc.) to the chopped, wet wood in the still. This increases the yield of oil, but it also creates a hazard of spot-burning of the woodchips. Similar to amyris, the age of the wood prior to distillation also has some influence upon the odor of the oil. The oil is a low-cost fixative and modifier, an excellent blender in woody-floral perfumes, in soap compounds as well as high-class perfumes. Guaiac wood oil is, in turn, sometimes found as an adulterant in rose de mai absolute, amyris oil, sandalwood oil, costus oil, oakmoss concr\u00e8te, etc.",

The composing of an artificial hyacinth perfume base is still a favorite problem for many perfumers. Frequent adulteration of the commercial lots of so-called hyacinth absolutes with narcissus absolute, violet leaf absolute, ylang-ylang, and a wealth of synthetic materials, has only encouraged perfumers to try composing their own hyacinth base, rather than buy adulterated material. Artificial hyacinth perfume bases may be composed from cinnamic alcohol, styrax products, phenyl propyl alcohol, phenyl acetaldehyde, phenyl ethyl alcohol, galbanum resinoid, ylang-ylang oils, isoeugenol, floranol, tolyl acetate, phenyl ethyl cinnamate, terpineol, hydroxycitronellal, methoxy phenyl butanone, amyl salicylate, benzyl cyanide, benzyl formate, amyl cinnamic aldehyde, indole, phenyl-ethyl dimethyl carbinol, etc.",

The odor and the nuances in the undertone varies according to the origin, production, age and method of purification. Jasmin absolute represents one of the most striking examples of nature\u2019s ability to round off and conceal\u2014or unsurpassably utilize\u2014the odor- effect of very simple odorants, e. g. benzyl acetate and linalool, the main constituents of jasmin absolute (in respect to quantity). Most perfumers have, at one time or another in their experience, tried to duplicate the jasmin fragrance by relying upon literature information as to the chemical composition of jasmin absolute. Jasmin Absolute from Concr\u00e8te is used in such a multitude and variety of perfumes that it is hardly possible to establish a rule for its use. \u201cNo perfume without jasmin\u201d is an old saying, and this is not far from the fact. The jasmin-rose complex forms the more important part or \u201cfond\u201d of numerous \u201cgrands parfums\u201d as well as quite ordinary perfumes and bases. The floral note, when required, is provided by the addition of jasmin absolute or any kind of a jasmin base in 8 out of 10 cases. And the practising perfume student will be surprised when he learns how little jasmin absolute he has to use in order to obtain just enough of a \u201cfloral\u201d note. With that fact in consideration, even a true jasmin absolute is rarely too expensive to use. ",

Jasmin Absolute from Pommade is a dark orange colored to dark reddish-brown, viscous liquid with a highly true-to-nature jasmin flower odor. By the nature of things, this perfume material has no odor of solvent, but upon ageing it may develop a slightly fatty off-note due to the extraction-fat. Modern anti-oxidants usually keep the fat from becoming rancid. The jasmin pommade-absolute varies in odor according to the method of extraction, the quality of the flower material, the age after picking, the location of the field, etc. Generally, the indole note is more pronounced in the pommade-absolute than in the absolute from concr\u00e8te.

Jasmin Concr\u00e8te is a solid, waxy, reddish-orange, dark orange, yellowish-orange or brownish mass.

However, the odor is more correctly evaluated in the jasmin absolute which is free from the waxes and other alcohol- insoluble and practically odorless materials. The waxes act as powerful odor-depressors, and the characteristic radiation or diffusion of the odor of the absolute will not appear until the waxes are removed. Jasmin Concr\u00e8te is not infrequently adulterated. The most common additive is the \u201cspent wax from the production of jasmin absolute. The odor of jasmin concr\u00e8te is perceptibly impaired by comparatively small additions of these almost odorless waxes. A \u201cspecial grade\u201d of Benzyl Acetate is offered by a few perfume houses who distil benzyl acetate over a certain amount of \u201cspent waxes\u201d from the production of jasmin absolute.
