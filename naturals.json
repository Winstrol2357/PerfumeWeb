After proper maceration of the wood, this oleo. resin will yield an essential oil upon distillation. Wood from infected trees is cut and coarsely chopped, then soaked in water prior to distillation. It is common practice to add salt (sodium chloride) to the water. Being a distillation at atmospheric pressure (100\u00b0C.), the process of total exhaustion of the wood is a lengthy one. The oil is high-boiling, and the distillation waters must be cohobated (i.e. returned to the still and redistilled) in order to produce a reasonable yield and a complete oil. Agar Oil is pale yellow to brownish yellow or dark amber in color; it is a very viscous liquid of rich and sweet-woody, almost balsamic odor not unlike that of vetiverol or purified styrenefree styrax, and with a sweetness similar to that of sandalwood oil.

As little as 0.02 grams of this poison is lethal to the average human being. This amount of hydrocyanic acid can be present in about 8 to 10 drops of crude, unrectified Bitter Almond Oil. It is interesting to note that hydrocyanic acid has an odor which is somewhat similar to that of Benzaldehyde, the main constituent of bitter almond oil. Bitter Almond Oil is a colorless liquid of strong, but sweet and clean odor, reminiscent of crushed, wet bitter almonds or of a very high grade of benzaldehyde. The odor is also familiar to those who prepare or enjoy the European candy known as \u201cMarcipan\u201d. Bitter Almond Oil, which is almost pure Benzaldehyde, is not a very stable oil. An addition of 10% (but not less) of ethyl alcohol is recommended as a stabilizer, and the oil should be stored in well filled glass containers, protected from daylight, moisture and air.

        "background": "Ambra, also called Ambregris or Ambergris, is a substance of animal tissue, formed in the stomach or intestine of Physeter Catodon, the cachalot whale. It is conceivable that Ambra is the result of a pathological condition caused by irritation of the whale\u2019s stomach walls due to certain indigestible particles in the whale\u2019s food. Consequently, Ambra is one of the few natural perfumery raw materials which cannot be \u201ccultivated\u201d. Pieces of Ambra are either washed ashore on various temperate ocean coasts and islands, or they are found inside the whales when these great mammals are captured for their oil. Ambra is a pale grayish or creamy-yellow to brown or dark brown waxy solid mass which melts in boiling water. Its odor is rather subtle, reminiscent of seaweed, wood, moss, with a peculiar sweet, yet very dry undertone of unequaled tenacity. There is rarely any animal note at all in a good grade of Ambra. The greater part of a good grade of Ambra is soluble in alcohol. By concentration of the tincture, the so-called Resinoid of Ambergris is obtained. When concentrated 20 times, the ambergris tincture turns into a light brown, semi-solid mass, which could be called \u201c20-fold tincture of ambergris\u201d. Ambra has comparatively little diffusive power, but it has a tremendous tenacity. Musk or Civet are required to improve the \u201cwearability\u201d of a perfume. Consequently, Ambra Tincture is particularly recommended in the more delicate florals, e.g. muguet, sweet pea, lilac, freesia, cyclamen, white rose, etc. In the modern aldehydic \u201cfantasy\u201d perfume bases, the use of Ambra or a similar \u201cbouquetting\u201d agent is a necessity in order to \u201cround off\u201d the stubborn chemical notes of aliphatic aldehydes.

Only the expressed oil from the peels of the fruits from the small bergamot tree, Citrus Bergamia, are of any substantial interest. The leaves and twigs may be distilled to yield a Bergamot-Petitgrain Oil, the fruits are not edible. Bergamot Oil is produced by cold expression from the peel of the nearly ripe fruit. The tree grows almost exclusively in a narrow coastal strip in the southern part of Calabria, Italy. Bergamot Oil is a green or olive green, mobile liquid of extremely rich, sweet-fruity initial odor. Although the characteristics of this topnote remain perceptible in good oils, it is followed by a still more characteristic oily-herbaceous and somewhat balsamic body and dryout. The sweetness yields to a more tobacco like and rich note, somewhat reminiscent of sage clary and nerylacetate. The freshness in the topnote is mainly due to terpenes and small amounts of citral and aliphatic aldehydes. Absence of the \u201coily\u201d note is one of the most revealing features in poor or adulterated bergamot oils. The color of bergamot oil fades on ageing, particularly when the oil is exposed to daylight. The oil turns yellow or pale olive-brown. The color is also dependent upon the maturity of the fruit at the moment of expressing. Like all other citrus oils, Bergamot Oil is produced in the immediate vicinity of the plantations. The oil is used extensively in perfumery for its sweet freshness, particularly in citrus colognes, chypres, foug\u00e8res, modern fantasy bases, etc. Part of the sweetness and rich bodynote is due to the presence of large amounts of linalylacetate combined with linalool and traces of methylanthranilate. Unlike most other citrus oils, Bergamot Oil has a certain fixative effect when used in fairly high concentrations. The odor of the oil is well balanced from nature through the presence of certain coumarin derivatives, some of which are odorless and non-volatile. ",

Certain users of high-grade terpeneless bergamot oil will perform their own deterpenation, e.g. by selective solvent extraction or by the chromatographic methods. These methods result in practically colorless oils with a negligible loss of low- boiling and important oxygenated components. Occasionally, only the coarse-smelling light monoterpenes and the waxy residues are removed by simple vacuum-distillation. This yields an oil which is well suited for perfumery purposes: it will have improved solubility and intensified, rich body notes. The freshness is greatly impaired by this deterpenation. As far as concentration is concerned, the terpeneless oil is only a little \u201cstronger\u201d in odor effect compared to the natural oil.

The dryout bears some resemblance to the dryout notes of Atlas cedarwood oil. The essential oil consists almost entirely of monoterpenes and has little perfumery value. Canada balsam is used to a limited extent as a fixative in finer pine needle fragrances to which it also lends a certain freshness.

The seeds are enclosed in husks (hulls), and should not be removed from the almost odorless hulls until immediately prior to distillation. Cardamom Oil is an almost colorless or pale yellow to light brownish liquid. It darkens when exposed to daylight. The locally distilled oils are generally darker than those distilled in Europe or the U.S.A. Guatemalan oil is distilled in comparatively modern equipment and under experienced technical supervision. It is also light colored. The odor of cardamom oil is warm-spicy, aromatic, at first penetrating camphoraceous-cineole-like or somewhat medicinal, reminiscent of eucalyptus. Later, it becomes balsamic-woody, increasingly sweet and almost floral on the dryout. The odor is extremely tenacious with a delightful, warm spiciness and balsamic-floral undertone. In perfumery, the oil will not only impart spiciness, but also a warm, sweet note which fits into floral bases such as muguet and rose. Coriander oil is an extremely fine modifier for cardamom oil in perfumery. The oil imparts warmth in Oriental perfume bases, chypres and face powder perfumes. ",

Used skillfully, it can impart warm notes in floral and Oriental compositions, in lavender bouquets, in modern fantasy and aldehydic perfumes, etc. Carelessly used, it may easily ruin a perfume. Its diffusive power and great odor tenacity should not be underestimated. ",

The oil of Ormenis Multicaulis is a pale yellow to brownish yellow, mobile liquid. It seems that light-colored oils are obtained at the beginning of the inflorescence (better perfume oils), and darker oils come in poorer yields at the end of the inflorescence. The odor of the pale oils is fresh-herbaceous, slightly camphoraceous, but soon changes into a sweet, cistus-like and richbalsamic undertone which is very tenacious and pleasant, almost ambra-like. The oil finds application in citrus-colognes, ambre-, chypre-, foug\u00e8re-bases, as well as in a multitude of other bases where a fresh modification of ambre-herbaceous notes are called for (lavender, pine, etc.). Even trace amounts of the oil may introduce a delightful topnote in a herbaceous or floral-herbaceous fragrance.",

        "background_info": "Champaca Absolute is obtained by extraction of the beautiful deep-yellow flowers of Michelia Champaca, a medium-sized slender tree, related to the magnolias. Champaca Concr\u00e8te is a dark yellow to orange- brown, solid, waxy mass of delightfully sweet and delicately floral fragrance. An Absolute of Champaca is produced by the usual method. It is a dark yellow or a brownish-orange colored, somewhat viscous liquid. Its odor is quite unique: delicately dry-floral, at the same time reminding one of orange flowers, ylang-ylang, carnation and tearose. There are notes which resemble those of sage clary, methyl eugenol and \u201cthe good old type\u201d of guaiacwood oil. Champaca Absolute is used in certain high-class perfumes where it may produce a unique, warm, floral-leafy note which is often compared to that of a fine grade of tea. However, its effect is not perceptible unless the absolute is skillfully backed up with rich, but weak-smelling blenders and modifiers. Sandalwood oil is an excellent fixative for the champaca fragrance, and so is isoeugenol, benzylsalicylate, etc.",
