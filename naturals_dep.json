Acaroid resinoid and Acaroid tincture are excellent fixatives for low-cost soap perfumes or industrial perfumes, particularly those of sweet balsamic type. The odor type of Acaroid is quite similar to that of peru, styrax, and tolu balsams, however, much weaker in odor strength. Apart from the color drawback, Acaroid could well replace the Sumatra benzoin, and it blends well with cinnamic aldehyde.",

        "background": "This oil is water-distilled from fungus-infected wood of the tree Aquilaria Agallocha, growing in northeastern India. Healthy trees have an odorless wood which produces no essential oil. Only older trees are attacked by the fungi; thereafter an oleoresin is produced inside the wood. After proper maceration of the wood, this oleo. resin will yield an essential oil upon distillation. Wood from infected trees is cut and coarsely chopped, then soaked in water prior to distillation. It is common practice to add salt (sodium chloride) to the water. Being a distillation at atmospheric pressure (100°C.), the process of total exhaustion of the wood is a lengthy one. The oil is high-boiling, and the distillation waters must be cohobated (i.e. returned to the still and redistilled) in order to produce a reasonable yield and a complete oil. Agar Oil is pale yellow to brownish yellow or dark amber in color; it is a very viscous liquid of rich and sweet-woody, almost balsamic odor not unlike that of vetiverol or purified styrenefree styrax, and with a sweetness similar to that of sandalwood oil. Agar Oil could find use in perfumery for oriental bases, woody-aldehydic bases, chypres, fougères, etc.",

        "background": "The Bitter Almond Tree is cultivated particularly in the U.S.A., Israel, Syria, Turkey Morocco, Spain and France. The botanical material contain a glycoside, Amygdalin, in the kernels. Enzymatic processes initiate the decomposition of this glycoside, whereby Benzaldehyde and Hydrocyanic Acid are formed. The crude essential oil thus contains ‘significant amounts of the highly toxic hydrocyanic acid which must be removed before the oil can be used in flavors or perfumes. As little as 0.02 grams of this poison is lethal to the average human being. This amount of hydrocyanic acid can be present in about 8 to 10 drops of crude, unrectified Bitter Almond Oil. It is interesting to note that hydrocyanic acid has an odor which is somewhat similar to that of Benzaldehyde, the main constituent of bitter almond oil. Bitter Almond Oil is a colorless liquid of strong, but sweet and clean odor, reminiscent of crushed, wet bitter almonds or of a very high grade of benzaldehyde. The odor is also familiar to those who prepare or enjoy the European candy known as “Marcipan”. Bitter Almond Oil, which is almost pure Benzaldehyde, is not a very stable oil. An addition of 10% (but not less) of ethyl alcohol is recommended as a stabilizer, and the oil should be stored in well filled glass containers, protected from daylight, moisture and air. Bitter Almond Oil finds very little use in perfumery where it is replaced by a high grade of benzaldehyde. They blend well with anisic-balsamic types of odor.",

        "background": "Ambra, also called Ambregris or Ambergris, is a substance of animal tissue, formed in the stomach or intestine of Physeter Catodon, the cachalot whale. It is conceivable that Ambra is the result of a pathological condition caused by irritation of the whale’s stomach walls due to certain indigestible particles in the whale’s food. Consequently, Ambra is one of the few natural perfumery raw materials which cannot be “cultivated”. Pieces of Ambra are either washed ashore on various temperate ocean coasts and islands, or they are found inside the whales when these great mammals are captured for their oil. Ambra is a pale grayish or creamy-yellow to brown or dark brown waxy solid mass which melts in boiling water. Its odor is rather subtle, reminiscent of seaweed, wood, moss, with a peculiar sweet, yet very dry undertone of unequaled tenacity. There is rarely any animal note at all in a good grade of Ambra. The greater part of a good grade of Ambra is soluble in alcohol. By concentration of the tincture, the so-called Resinoid of Ambergris is obtained. When concentrated 20 times, the ambergris tincture turns into a light brown, semi-solid mass, which could be called “20-fold tincture of ambergris”. Ambra has comparatively little diffusive power, but it has a tremendous tenacity. Musk or Civet are required to improve the “wearability” of a perfume. Consequently, Ambra Tincture is particularly recommended in the more delicate florals, e.g. muguet, sweet pea, lilac, freesia, cyclamen, white rose, etc. In the modern aldehydic “fantasy” perfume bases, the use of Ambra or a similar “bouquetting” agent is a necessity in order to “round off” the stubborn chemical notes of aliphatic aldehydes.

The note is also slightly musky-animal-like with a spicy undertone. Various lactones, occurring in trace amounts in the oil, are held responsible for these special effects of the oil and for the synergistic effect it imparts to other perfume materials in compositions. One of these lactones is Cyclopentadecanolide.
