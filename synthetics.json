        "background_info": "The pure material is almost white, crystalline plates or powder. Melting point: 174-182\u00b0C. Lower-grade commercial material is usually off-white or pale straw-colored, with granular crystals or a conglomerated mass that has a much lower melting point. Insoluble in water, it is soluble in alcohol and oils. It is also soluble in an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. The pure material is virtually odorless, while the commercial material has a faint, pleasant resinous odor. Abietic acid is slightly bitter at concentrations of more than 50 ppm. It is also the natural source and parent of several solvent-fixatives used in perfumery: Abitol, Methyl Abietate (Abalyn), and hydrogenated Methyl Abietate (Hercolyn). Rosin, the natural material, is occasionally used as a fixative in Pine and other fragrance types. It is inexpensive and has, at times, been popular in certain types of soap perfume. Certain derivatives of Abietic acid are used as emulsifiers and 'cloudifiers' in carbonated beverages to give the visual impression of fruit juice content in drinks made with little or no 'cloudy' natural juice. 'Cloudy' orange sodas are popular in certain countries. Production: By distillation of rosin (e.g., from American turpentine) or by treatment with acid to isomerize the natural levopimaric acid. Purification is done using the diamylammonium salt. Molecular Weight: 302.46",

This material is briefly mentioned in this work because it represents a milestone in perfume chemistry research (connected with Vitamin and Hormone research). It may also help further elucidate monographs and materials mentioned under the titles: Sclareol or Abietic acid. Ambrein is an odorless solid material, but it serves as the parent of numerous very important ambergris perfume materials, including those found in nature. Oxidation products of Ambrein have been manufactured, opening the door to the partial synthesis of the ambergris odor. One commercial product, Ambrone T or Ambrone Clair (Takasago Perfumery Co. Ltd., Japan), is produced through ozonolysis of odorless Ambrein and concentration of the odorous, volatile oxidation products. Since natural ambergris contains substantial amounts of odorless Ambrein, the ozonolysis method increases the yield of perfume-grade odorous ambergris material. Mother Nature\u2019s incomplete synthesis has been completed by human innovation. Among the odorous derivatives of Ambrein are: Ambrenolide (Lactones, C\u2081\u2086H\u2082\u2084O\u2082) Decalin derivatives Ambrenols - liquid or solid, tertiary alcohols (Octalin derivatives) Cyclohomogeraniol and related materials Dihydro-gamma-ionone Cyclopropan derivatives Various epoxides and aldehydes.

They are natural components of ambergris and are considered of major importance to the olfactory properties of natural ambergris and ambergris tincture.\n\nAlthough these materials have been synthesized and also obtained as isolates from natural ambergris, they are not yet commercially available under the name Ambrinol. Closely related chemicals are synthesized at lower cost but lack the same attractive olfactory effect.\n\nThe eye-catching structural similarity between Ambrinols and Ambrein, Sclareol, Abietic acid, Dihydro-gamma-ionone, etc., has been the subject of much discussion in modern perfumery literature.\n\nWhen the title materials become commercially available at an attractive price, they will undoubtedly find their way into perfumery, contributing to amber bases, new perfume types, and specialties.
