M.P. 174-182\u201d C.\nLower grade commercial material is usually\noff-white or pale straw-colored, granular\ncrystals or conglomerated mass with much\nlower melting point.\nInsoluble in water, soluble in alcohol and\noils. Also soluble in aqueous solution of\nSodium hydroxide.\nThe pure material is virtually odorless. The\nmmmercial material has a faint, pleasantresinous\nodor.\nAbietic acid is slightly bitter at concentrations\nof more than 50 ppm. It is also the natural source and parent of\nseveral solvent-fixatives, used in perfumery:\nAbitol, Methyl abietate (Abalyn) and hydrogenated\nMethyl abietate (Hercolyn).\nRosin, the natural material, is occasionally\nused as a fixative in Pine and other fragrance\ntypes. It is inexpensive and has at times been\npopular in certain types of soap perfume.\nCertain derivatives of Abietic acid are used\nas emulsifiers and \u201ccloudificators\u201d in carbonated\nbeverages - to give visual impression of\nfruit juice content in beverages made with\nlittle or no \u201ccloudy\u201d natural juice. \u201cCloudy\u201d\nOrange sodas are popular in certain countries.\nProd. : by distillation of Rosin (from\nAmerican Turpentine, e. g.) or by treatment\nwith acid to isomenze the natural Levopimaric\nacid.
